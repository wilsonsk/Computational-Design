# Digital Form Finding
In architecture and engineering it refers to the **process of designing optimal structural shapes by using experimental tools and strategies (i.e. physical modes) to simulate a specific mechanical behavior**.
## The Reverse Hanging Method
Refers to physical model, made with elastic cables or membranes with no rotational stiffness. 
	It is first subject to gravitational forces to **obtain a structural state of pure tension**.
		Such a form is called **"funicular"**.
	It is then inverted to identify the mechanical [[#Compression-Only|compression-only]] situation. 
		*"As hangs the flexible line, so but inverted will stand the rigid arch."*
			**[[#Catenary Curve|Catenary Curve]] in [[#Tension|Tension]]**: When a chain hangs freely between two points, it naturally forms a catenary curve under the influence of gravity. 
				- In this situation, the chain is in pure tension; it is only being pulled apart by its own weight and the force of gravity.
					- The weight of the chain or cable itself causes it to sag under gravity, and the shape it naturally takes is the result of the material responding to these tensile forces.
						- In this scenario, the tension is along the length of the chain, pulling each link downward towards the earth and outwards towards the supports.
			**[[#Inverted Catenary as Compression-Only Structures|Inverting the Curve for Compression]]**: Hooke observed that if this curve is inverted (turned upside down), it forms an ideal arch shape for bearing loads in [[#Compression-Only (i.e. pure compression)|pure compression]]. 
				- This means that when built in the shape of an inverted catenary, an arch can ideally distribute the downward forces of its own weight and any additional loads, ensuring structural stability without any tensile stress.

The oldest and probably most diffused form-finding technique for arches, vaults and shells.
	First mentioned by Robert Hooke in 1675. 
		He proposed to reverse the **[[#Catenary Curve|curve]]** which was generated by hanging a chain, under self-weight and supported only at its ends, in order to define the optimal structural form of an arch.
### Tension
This is the opposite of compression; it occurs when particles of a material are pulled apart. In structures, tension forces tend to elongate or stretch the material. 
	*Example:* The forces acting on a cable or rope in a suspension bridge.
##### Considerations, Limitations, and Concerns 
###### Material Limitations
- **Strength Characteristics**: Many traditional building materials, such as masonry (stone, brick) and plain concrete, are very strong in compression but relatively weak in tension. These materials can crack and fail under tensile forces because they lack the ability to stretch or bend without breaking.
- **Historical Construction Techniques**: In historical architectures, such as ancient bridges, cathedrals, and arches, the primary building materials were those that performed poorly under tension. This necessitated design approaches that minimized or eliminated tensile stresses.
###### Durability Concerns
- **Cracking**: Tensile stresses can cause cracking, particularly in brittle materials like concrete and stone. Cracks not only diminish the structural capacity of an element but also allow for the ingress of moisture and chemicals, which can accelerate deterioration, especially in harsh environments.
- **Longevity**: Structures designed to minimize tensile stresses often have longer lifespans, particularly in corrosive environments where cracks or splits could lead to accelerated degradation through rust or frost damage.
###### Safety and Reliability
- **Predictability of Failure**: Materials that are weak in tension, like unreinforced masonry, fail in a more sudden and less predictable manner than those failing in compression. This can pose greater risks in terms of structural reliability and safety.
- **Redundancy**: In tensile systems, particularly those involving elements like cables or slender members, a failure in one component can lead to overstressing and subsequent failure in others, leading to a cascading effect. Compression-only structures tend to distribute loads more evenly and stably.
###### Economic Factors
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Avoiding tensile stresses can be economically advantageous in certain cases. For example, using materials that handle compressive stress well is typically less expensive than using engineered solutions necessary to handle tensile stresses effectively.
- **Maintenance Costs**: Structures that experience significant tensile stresses may require more frequent maintenance and monitoring to ensure their integrity, adding to their long-term cost.
###### Aesthetic and Design Flexibility
- **Architectural Aesthetics**: Some architectural styles, especially those that emphasize continuity, symmetry, and smoothness, benefit from the aesthetics of compression-only structures. Arches and domes, which are purely compressive structures, are classic examples that provide aesthetic pleasure and historical architectural significance.
###### Construction Simplicity
- **Simpler Construction Techniques**: Compression-only structures can be simpler to construct, as they require less concern about the buckling or bending that can accompany tensile elements. This can make the construction process faster and reduce the need for specialized labor or materials.
### Catenary Curve
![[Pasted image 20240430134246.png|300]]
The curve referred to by Hooke.
A **catenary curve** is a type of curve formed by a chain hanging freely from two points under the influence of gravity. 
	This curve represents the shape that the chain takes when it is supported only at its ends and is acted upon solely by its own weight. 
		The term "catenary" is derived from the Latin word "catena," which means "chain."
A curve is catenary when the chain presents a constant distribution of weight. 
	The catenary curve is under [[#Tension|tension]] â€”the weight of the chain or cable pulls it downward, stretching it along its length.
###### Mathematical Description
Mathematically, the catenary curve can be described by the hyperbolic cosine function. The standard equation for a catenary curve is: $y=acosh(x/a$) where:
- $cosh$ is the hyperbolic cosine function.
- $a$ is a constant that dictates the curve's steepness and the distance between its lowest point and the horizontal asymptotes.
- $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of points on the curve.
###### Properties
- **Geometric Shape**: The catenary curve has a characteristic U-like shape, more specifically resembling an upside-down chain curve.
- **Optimal Structural Shape**: When inverted, the catenary curve describes the optimal arch shape for supporting loads. This shape effectively distributes gravitational forces along the curve, minimizing bending moments, which is ideal for structures like arches and vaults.
- **Stability**: The form of the catenary is inherently stable when subjected to uniform gravitational forces, which is why it is often used in the design of suspension bridges, arches, and other similar structures.
#### Compression-Only (i.e. pure compression)
Refers to a situation where the structural elements of a building or object are subjected solely to compression forces, without any tension forces acting on them.
	In a structural context, a compression force tends to shorten or compress the material it acts upon. 
		*Example:* The forces exerted on the columns of a building, pushing them downwards towards the earth.
##### Compression-Only Structures
When we refer to "compression-only" in architecture or structural engineering, we mean that the structural elements are **designed to support loads through compression without any tension**. 
	The materials in these structures do not handle tensile stresses; they only push against each other to transmit loads.
###### Optimal Load Distribution:
Structures designed to handle loads in compression-only are optimized to ensure that all stresses imposed by external loads, like weight and environmental forces, result in compressive stresses. 
	These structures are devoid of bending moments and tensile stresses, which can lead to structural inefficiencies and potential failure in materials weak in tension.
###### Material Suitability
Many traditional building materials, such as stone, brick, and unreinforced concrete, are very strong in compression but relatively weak in tension. 
	Designing structures that utilize these materials in compression-only modes is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and longevity.
##### Inverted Catenary as Compression-Only Structures
When a catenary curve is inverted (flipped upside down), the curve no longer represents a chain hanging under gravity, but rather mimics an idealized arch form.
	It becomes an ideal shape for an arch that supports loads primarily through compression. 
- **Gravity and Structural Load**: In the inverted catenary (now resembling an arch), the primary force is gravity acting downwards on the structure. If the arch is constructed in the exact shape of the inverted catenary curve, the gravitational forces push directly down along the curve.
- **Force Distribution**: In this configuration, the forces are transmitted along the curve towards the supports at either end, instead of pulling the structure apart (as in tension), they push it together. This direct compression is efficiently managed because the curve directs all the force components towards the arch's supports, and no part of the force acts to elongate or stretch the arch, which would introduce tension.
- **Arch Stability and Compression**: The arch form effectively translates the vertical forces of the weight and any additional loads into compressive stresses within the arch. The specific geometry of the inverted catenary ensures that these compressive forces are uniformly distributed along the curve of the arch, reducing or eliminating bending moments. Bending moments, if present, could introduce tensile stresses, but the catenary form helps bypass this issue by ensuring that the load paths maintain compression throughout.
- **Optimal Load Distribution**: The shape of an inverted catenary curve ensures that any load applied to the arch is uniformly distributed along the curve, minimizing or eliminating bending moments. This uniform distribution is what allows the arch to function in [[#Compression-Only (i.e. pure compression)|pure compression]].
- **No Tensile Stress**: In an ideal scenario, where the shape matches an inverted catenary perfectly and external forces are uniformly distributed, the arch will not experience any tensile stress. This scenario is what is meant by "[[#Compression-Only (i.e. pure compression)|pure compression]]." It is a situation where the structural integrity of the arch is maintained solely through compressive forces.
##### Why No Tension in Inverted Catenary
- **No Perpendicular Forces**: In the ideal inverted catenary arch, there are no significant horizontal tensile forces because all the load is vertical and directed downward through the archâ€™s curve. The architectural design and materials ensure that the structure only has to deal with compression.
- **Material Behavior**: Most traditional arch materials, like stone or unreinforced concrete, cannot handle tensile stress effectively but are excellent at handling compressive forces. Thus, designing them in the form of an inverted catenary optimizes their inherent material properties.
###### Why Use Inverted Catenary Curves
The practical application of inverted catenary curves in architecture is based on their ability to handle loads efficiently in compression, which is particularly important for materials like stone or unreinforced concrete that are strong in compression but weak in tension. 
	Historical structures, such as the arches in Gothic cathedrals, demonstrate the use of this principle, even though the builders may not have formally understood the mathematics of catenary curves.
##### Infinite Ideal Forms of a Compression-Only Arch
![[Pasted image 20240430142137.png|600]]
These forms can be generated by **varying two boundary conditions.**
1. The **applied loading**.
2. The **span/rise ratio**.
##### Applied Loading (i.e. the load)
Refers to the forces exerted on the arch, including the weight of the arch itself (self-weight), any additional static loads (like the weight of materials or objects resting on the arch), and dynamic loads (such as those from wind or seismic activity).
###### Influence on Arch Design
The pattern and magnitude of loading directly affect the structural requirements of the arch. For a compression-only arch to maintain its integrity, the shape of the arch must distribute these loads through pure compression down into the foundations. By altering the load conditionsâ€”whether changing the amount of load or the points at which it is appliedâ€”the optimal shape of the arch will change to adapt to these new conditions.
###### Practical Implication
For instance, an arch designed to carry a heavy roof will have a different thickness and curvature compared to one designed only to span an open space without additional loads. Adjusting the design to suit specific loading conditions ensures that the arch remains stable and structurally sound under different scenarios.
##### Span/Rise Ratio
###### Span of an Arch
 Is the **distance between its two supports** - i.e. the horizontal length across the ground.
###### Rise of an Arch
Is the **height of the arch from the base to the highest point** - i.e. the vertical height at the midpoint between the supports.
###### Influence on Arch Design: 
The span/rise ratio significantly affects the structural and aesthetic characteristics of the arch. 
	A higher ratio (wider span relative to the rise) generally results in a flatter arch, while a lower ratio (shorter span relative to the rise) results in a taller, more peaked arch.
###### Practical Implication:
The curvature of the arch must be precisely calculated to handle compression under its specific span and rise conditions.
	A flatter arch will have different stresses and require a different curvature than a steeper arch to ensure that all forces are adequately transferred in compression. 
		This ratio is critical in determining the archâ€™s stability, load capacity, and overall appearance.
### Tri-Dimensional Application of Pure Compression
This same principle can be extended to the three dimensions in order to find structural form of the a structure (ex. reinforced concrete, masonry vaults and shells, steel or timber gridshells).
