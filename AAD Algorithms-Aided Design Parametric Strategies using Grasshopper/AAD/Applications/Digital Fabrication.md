# Digital Fabrication
Fabrication has always been in a crucial relationship with design (industrial, architecture).
The manufacturing techniques, assembly processes, and materials often prompt shifts in design. 

*For example*: 
The introduction of structural steel fabrication, influenced the design of structures, facilitated new formal ideas.
But also required new understanding and consideration in detailing and pre fabrication.
- I.e. The introduction of a new component within the design process, influenced a new the production, marginalizing handcraft and pushing the designer into an essential role within the build process. 

## Assemblies
Refers to the construction or arrangement of various parts or components that come together to form a complete object or system. 

Assemblies involve the consideration (i.e. design decisions) of fit and functional relationships between different components. 
	The manufacturing techniques, assembly procedures, and materials can prompt significant shifts in a design.
		I.e. The interrelationships between components dictates the overall design and functionality of an outcome.  
## Before the Digital Revolution
The management of complexity within building projects, involved the designer:
	Decomposing components into their fundamental components.
	Studying part to whole assembly strategies, via scale models and drawings. 
		The scale models and subsequent construction drawings were then transferred to suppliers and contractors to interpret and fabricate the assembly components. 

This process was constrained to working with orthogonal structures, lacking the ability to handle complex shapes.
	With few notable exceptions:
		Jorn Utzon, Heinz Isler, Antoni Gaudi, etc.

The digital revolution removed this constraint, by integrating design output directly with fabrication. 
## Digital Revolution
### The first stage:
Controls the project by generating digital, tri-dimensional model (3D model) as a primary source.
	From which all necessary bi-dimensional (2D) components (plans, sections, elevations, details) can be generated from via computer interpretation. 
		I.e. The building processes are directly interpreted from this 3D primary source. 
#### Informed Digital Fabrication
This digital controlling source is called **Informed digital fabrication**:
	Which itself is a framework or workflow where digital data directly drives manufacturing equipment to form various parts such as (component geometries, shapes, fabrication and assembly).
		I.e. CAD (Computer-aided design) to CAM (Computer-aided manufacturing).

#### CNC
Computer Numerical Control:
	Refers to the use of computer in driving and controlling a machine's movements.
		For example: a milling cutter, a lathe, a laser or waterjet cutter, etc.

CNC processes are an informed digital fabrication, and directly link 3D geometry to the final components.
	Removing the need for and thus production of drawings.
		The use of traditional drawings is now limited to merely aiding in the assembly of components. 
			Drawings can be all together bypassed by printing assembly instructions directly on components.
				Future implications are instructions that are provided in the form of coded instruction sets. 

Informed digital fabrication (i.e. the automated production of components) improves accuracy and makes complexity and thus managing it, not complicated. 
	Where a complex operation will have the same level of machining difficulty as a simple operation. 
##### Future Implications
###### Rapid Prototyping
An additive fabrication technique in which material is deposited in layers to print a component. 
	Facilitating the generation of a physical object from a 3D model. 
## Fabrication Techniques
Can be sorted according to processes and materials.
### (2D) Bi-dimensional Cutting 
2D fabrications transform planar sheets of: aluminum, steel, plywood acrylic, etc. of varying thickness into tri-dimensional assemblies. 

**Planar sheets** can be used to form geometries using techniques such as: stacking, faceting, etc. 
**Flat sheets** can be *bent* to form complex [[Gaussian Curvature#Developable Surfaces|developable geometries]], or geometries with [[Gaussian Curvature#Null Gaussian Curvature|null Gaussian Curvature]].
