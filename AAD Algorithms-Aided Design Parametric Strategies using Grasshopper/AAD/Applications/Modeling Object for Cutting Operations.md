# Modeling Object for Cutting Operations
Objects that are unable to be manufactured by means of [[Digital Fabrication#Additive Techniques|additive processes]] can be fabricated using [[Digital Fabrication#(2D) Bi-dimensional Cutting|cutting (i.e. subtractive processes)]] based operations.
## Sectioning
Refers to contouring a model in one direction.
It is a common technique used to build complex shapes by defining planar [[Gaussian Curvature#Developable Surfaces|developable surfaces]].
	
*For example*: A freeform surface can be sliced into a set of parallel and planar sections based on an interval equal to the thickness of the material to be [[Digital Fabrication#CNC Milling machines|milled]].
