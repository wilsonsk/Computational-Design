## Three Ages and the Dichotomy of Architectural Design
As Mario Carpo points out in his The Alphabet and the Algorithm book,' we can identify three technical ages - the age of hand-making, the age of mechanical-making, and the age of digital-making.

This distinction is of particular relevance if we think of the intrinsic dichotomy of architectural design: on the one hand, the built environment is based on the production of material objects, which in turn depend on the evolution of manufacturing technologies; whereas on the other hand, architectural design translates into abstract operations that are very much influenced by cultural environments and medium of representation.
## The Implications of Variations
Hand-making creates variations, as does digital making; but the capacity to design and mass-produce serial variations (or differentially) is specific to the present digital environment. Unlimited variability, however, may result in a loss of relevance and ultimately in a loss of meaning. 

During the 1990's, the digital revolution began to narrow down the gap between design and fabrication. 
	Computers, in fact, not only could easily deliver tools for the ideation and manipulation of complex mathematical forms; these new tools could also be directly applied to the conception, representation, and production of objects.
	
Back then Bernard Cache stated that ‘‘mathematics has effectively become an object o f manufacture," and Greg Lynn remarked that computer-aided design had "allowed architects to explore calculus based forms for the first time." 
	The concept of multiple variations then emerged to define this new idea of the digitally-made object, what Deleuze would refer to as objectile - a function that contains an infinite number of objects'*.

***"The objectile is not an object but an algorithm - a parametric function which may determine an infinite variety of objects, all different (one for each set of parameters) yet all similar (as the underlying function is the same for all). Instead of focusing on one instance from a virtual series of many, the new technological paradigm is increasingly dealing with variations that can all be designed and fabricated sequentially: mathematical continuity in this case is set in a manufacturing series, not in a diachronic sequence, and used to mass produce the infinite variants of the same objectile - at the same unit cost as identical copies."*** - Giles Deleuze
#### Smart Geometry
Smart geometry, also known as parametric design, is a rule-based geometry that links geometric shapes with variables. It allows for the transformation of geometry lines, arcs, circles, solids, and surfaces, and the embedding of fixed or variable parameters. This allows for the control and manipulation of geometry, which in turn increases the number of new controlled building forms. Smart geometry provides advanced design concepts and increases alternative variations. 

Smart geometry is not only about computation, but also about fabrication, or the relationship between the design process and the fabrication and construction process. Smart materials can respond to changes in the environment without the need for controls or energy when embedded with intelligent geometries using current computational and fabrication technologies.

 SG calls for a re-consideration of the design process, where the creation of computational mechanisms become an integral part of designing – not a task done prior to or separate from the process. 
### The Non-Standard Series
This technological shift defines the basic principles of a non-standard series. 
A set in which each element has some features in common with all others. 
### Mass Customization
Marketing term born from rise of CAD-CAM technologies around 1987. 
	Conceptual framework for processes initially from the clothing industry.
		Identifies that *mass customization* simply extends the capabilities inherent in CAD/CAM processes. 

Production Systems broken down into three main categories:
1. Craft production
2. Mass production
3. Mass customization
	- Which combines elements of the (1) and (2). 
### Endless Repetition does not Equal Solutions
The exponentially growing computational tools has equal potential of leading to proximities as it does leading to discrepancies between the physical world and digital worlds. 

*"We went to all this effort in order to solve real social, environmental and technical problems where we believed a computer could significantly assist. But now that there is a massive computer power and software cheaply available, most scripting has become nothing more than an onanistic self indulgence in a cozy graphic environment Endless repetition and variation on elaborate geometrical schema with no apparent social, environmental and technical purpose whatsoever."* 
- John Frazer (*Scripting Cultures: Architectural design and programming*)
### Paradigm Shift
Maybe the paradigm shift isn't that of the *role* of innovation - i.e. innovation for innovation's sake.

The more beneficial paradigm shift might be in the conceptual approach to innovation.
	Where there is an emphasis on the role of environment as a factor in affecting an idea, supporting that idea's development, as well as its eventual implementation and dissemination. 

**Where innovative technologies and processes are developed to be an agent of change for the better.** 
	Where the **role/integration** of **material processes** and **systems** in the built environment, are the real subject of research and "innovation". 
##### *Example of this paradigm shift*:
Design Robotics Group (DRG) at the Graduate School of Design of Harvard University

Innovation is what actually drives the research activities pursued by the Design Robotics Group (DRG) at the Graduate School of Design of Harvard University. The research unit, led by Professor Martin Bechthold, promotes the understanding, development and deployment of innovative technologies in the use of design as an agent of change in the quest for a better future. DRG looks at the role of material processes and systems in the built environment, with a special interest in robotic and computer-numerically controlled (CNC) fabrication processes. Combining issues of design computation, materials and assembly processes, the projects result in speculative prototypes as well as applied research geared towards industry integration. DRG work in material systems is best characterized as process-oriented, strategic and focused on performance. An example of the implementation of the design-oriented research pursued by the Harvard DRG is the 'Ceramics 2.0' Workshop Cluster at the 2012 SmartGeometry, where ceramic material systems were explored through a combination of computational design methods and a six-axis robotic manipulator equipped with a wire-cutting tool. Run by Prof. Martin Bechthold, Jose Luis Garcia del Castillo, Aurgho Jyoti, Nathan King and the author, the workshop built upon the 'Flowing Matter' project developed at Harvard GSD." Going back and forth between manual and robotic clay manipulation, workshop participants developed design intuitions that expanded beyond what would have been feasible when limited to either physical or computational methods. Exploring a material system in this open-ended manner generated a host of powerful ideas and much discussion. The workshop demonstrated that design robotics has matured to a point that brainstorming and sketching are now possible in newly hybridized modes that combine robotics with exploratory hands-on experiments.
###### The Result:
The result of this research on ceramic building systems was the articulation of the "*Revolving Brick*" project.
	Which introduced the concept of **strategic customization** in the industrial fabrication context. 

The project integrated robotic technology into the production process.
	Which enabled ability to overcome traditional rectangular brick forms, while maintaining the efficiency of time tested mass production methods. 

By **combining the material properties and geometric parameters**, this research shows that it is possible to optimize the material configuration to generate solar-selective thermal mass systems that include self-shading. 
	By **leveraging the advantages of the geometric complexity** available through the proposed shading process, the new material systems merges aesthetics and environmental performance by creating design pattern articulations that respond to variable climate and diurnal cycles (i.e. the variations in meteorological parameters such as temperature and relative humidity over the course of a 4 hour day).
		The resulting integrated workflow would eventually let both architects and manufacturers re-think the way brick building systems can be used, and let designers re-create novel and unexpected relationships with this traditional material.

Abstractly, the newly developed brick forms were the manifestation of innovation at the level of manufacturing, which affected and enabled the development of an idea - the solar selective thermal mass systems. 
	Manufacturing redesigned.
