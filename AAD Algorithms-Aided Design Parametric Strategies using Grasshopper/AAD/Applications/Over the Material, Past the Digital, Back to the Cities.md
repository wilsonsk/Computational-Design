## Three Ages and the Dichotomy of Architectural Design
As Mario Carpo points out in his The Alphabet and the Algorithm book,' we can identify three technical ages - the age of hand-making, the age of mechanical-making, and the age of digital-making.

This distinction is of particular relevance if we think of the intrinsic dichotomy of architectural design: on the one hand, the built environment is based on the production of material objects, which in turn depend on the evolution of manufacturing technologies; whereas on the other hand, architectural design translates into abstract operations that are very much influenced by cultural environments and medium of representation.
## The Implications of Variations
Hand-making creates variations, as does digital making; but the capacity to design and mass-produce serial variations (or differentially) is specific to the present digital environment. Unlimited variability, however, may result in a loss of relevance and ultimately in a loss of meaning. 

During the 1990's, the digital revolution began to narrow down the gap between design and fabrication. 
	Computers, in fact, not only could easily deliver tools for the ideation and manipulation of complex mathematical forms; these new tools could also be directly applied to the conception, representation, and production of objects.
	
Back then Bernard Cache stated that ‘‘mathematics has effectively become an object o f manufacture," and Greg Lynn remarked that computer-aided design had "allowed architects to explore calculus based forms for the first time." 
	The concept of multiple variations then emerged to define this new idea of the digitally-made object, what Deleuze would refer to as objectile - a function that contains an infinite number of objects'*.

***"The objectile is not an object but an algorithm - a parametric function which may determine an infinite variety of objects, all different (one for each set of parameters) yet all similar (as the underlying function is the same for all). Instead of focusing on one instance from a virtual series of many, the new technological paradigm is increasingly dealing with variations that can all be designed and fabricated sequentially: mathematical continuity in this case is set in a manufacturing series, not in a diachronic sequence, and used to mass produce the infinite variants of the same objectile - at the same unit cost as identical copies."*** - Giles Deleuze
### The Non-Standard Series
This technological shift defines the basic principles of a non-standard series. 
A set in which each element has some features in common with all others.
