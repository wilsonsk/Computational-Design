# How to Improve Computational and Parametric Intuition

## Deconstruction of a "one" abstraction to evaluate the "many" compositional elements
## Exercises:
Spend time **observing** geometries of objects.
- Think about different ways to generate them.
	- For example: A doorknob. 
		- Maybe it could be generated...
			- A sequence of proportional scalings of a circle along a direction.
			- Or two circle directrices and a curved generatrix.
