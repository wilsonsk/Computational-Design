# Abstract Mathematical Objects
## Mathematical objects are what we talk and write about when we do math.

How we [[Language|talk]] about math objects show how we _think_ about them.

The abstract "environment" facilitates a space where variables and the interrelationships between them can be discerned and analyzed.
	In contrast to the "real physical environment".
		Where the complexity and scale (nuclear, micro and macro, ...) makes identifying "true" causality nearly impossible.
