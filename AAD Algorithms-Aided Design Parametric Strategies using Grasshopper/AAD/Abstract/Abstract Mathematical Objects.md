# Abstract Mathematical Objects
## Mathematical objects are what we talk and write about when we do math.

How we [[Language|talk]] about math objects show how we _think_ about them.


## Abstract, Non-Physical Environments
The abstract "environment" facilitates a space where variables and the interrelationships between them can be discerned and analyzed.
	In contrast to the "real physical environment".
		Where the complexity and scale (nuclear, micro and macro, ...) makes identifying "true" causality nearly impossible. 

**Quantum Mechanics**: 
In quantum mechanics, abstract mathematical objects and environments are crucial. Concepts such as wave functions, quantum states, and operators are all abstract entities that do not have direct physical analogues. These objects help in formulating theories that explain phenomena at subatomic levels, which are not observable in the classical sense​​.
    
**General Relativity**: 
In the field of general relativity, the geometry of spacetime is modeled using the abstract mathematical framework of differential geometry. This includes concepts like manifolds, tensors, and curvature, which do not correspond to physical objects but rather to properties of spacetime itself.
    
**Theoretical Computer Science**:
Abstract environments are foundational in theoretical computer science, particularly in the study of algorithms and computational complexity. Here, abstract mathematical objects such as graphs, trees, and various data structures are used to model and solve complex problems​​.
    
**String Theory**: 
String theory and other theories of quantum gravity use highly abstract mathematical frameworks to describe phenomena that combine quantum mechanics with gravity. These theories often involve extra dimensions and complex topologies that are beyond direct physical observation.
    
**Statistical Mechanics**: 
In statistical mechanics, abstract mathematical tools are used to study the behaviors of systems at a macroscopic scale through the statistical properties of their microscopic components. This involves abstract spaces and measures that model distributions and behaviors of particles
