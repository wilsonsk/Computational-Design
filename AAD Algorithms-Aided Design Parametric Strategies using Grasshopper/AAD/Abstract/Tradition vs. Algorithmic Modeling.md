# Traditional Modeling vs. Algorithmic Modeling

## [[Digital Informing Creativity#The Mental Process of Design|Requires a Mental Shift in the Understanding of Design]] and in [[Computational Design Thinking#The Synthesis of Process as a as a Model|The Synthesis of Process Itself]]

## Associative Logic of Computational and Parametric Design
The design process itself is about establishing interrelationships between the dimensions dependent upon various parameters.

Additive vs. Subtractive vs. Associative
Each has its own mental processes/mechanisms associated. 
As each is a [[Language|language]] and thus a way of thinking and understanding. 

Traditional Drawing is an additive process and is not a "smart medium".
Additive logic and mental process/mechanism is about adding information.


Digital modeling has traditionally been based on virtual manipulation, by the pseudo physical presence of the mouse and keyboard in the digital environment. Algorithmic modeling, conversely, is based on logic and is void of "physical" manipulation. Algorithms rely on the ability to establish conceptual associations between geometry and mathematics. In other words, data is manipulated instead of digital objects. An algorithm can be imagined as a network of data streams, and in order to selectively operate on the network, is necessary to filter, divert and modify data to virtually manipulate geometry. Within this context mathematics and logic are the mouse and keyboard.

"Form-making, loosely defined, is a process of inspiration and refinement (form precedes analysis of programmatic influences and design constraints) versus form-finding as (loosely) a process of discovery and editing (form emerges from analysis). Extreme form-making is not architecture but sculpture [...]. Extreme form-finding also is not architecture but applied engineering, where form exclusively determined by function".^
