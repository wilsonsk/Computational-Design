Digital modeling has traditionally been based on virtual manipulation, by the pseudo physical presence of the mouse and keyboard in the digital environment. Algorithmic modeling, conversely, is based on logic and is void of "physical" manipulation. Algorithms rely on the ability to establish conceptual associations between geometry and mathematics. In other words, data is manipulated instead of digital objects. An algorithm can be imagined as a network of data streams, and in order to selectively operate on the network, is necessary to filter, divert and modify data to virtually manipulate geometry. Within this context mathematics and logic are the mouse and keyboard.

"Form-making, loosely defined, is a process of inspiration and refinement (form precedes analysis of programmatic influences and design constraints) versus form-finding as (loosely) a process of discovery and editing (form emerges from analysis). Extreme form-making is not architecture but sculpture [...]. Extreme form-finding also is not architecture but applied engineering, where form exclusively determined by function".^
