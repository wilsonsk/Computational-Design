# Cybernetics
Cybernetics is a field of study that deals with systems, control, and communication in biology, machines, and organizations. 

It focuses on how systems regulate themselves, control their behavior, and communicate internally and with their environment.

The foundational goal of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that exhibit complex behaviors and to apply these concepts to various fields for practical purposes.

The core concept of cybernetics is the **feedback loop**.
	The process where systems self-regulate by using the results of their actions to modify their subsequent behaviors to achieve desired outcomes. 
		This process can be observed in both biological organisms and technological systems.

1. **Feedback Loops**: Cybernetics introduces the idea of feedback loopsâ€”positive and negative. Positive feedback amplifies system output, potentially leading to growth or runaway effects. Negative feedback reduces discrepancies between the desired and actual states of a system, promoting stability.
    
2. **Control and Regulation**: Cybernetics studies how systems maintain stability or reach a desired state through regulation and control mechanisms. This can apply to mechanical systems, biological organisms, social organizations, and ecological systems.
    
3. **Communication**: The concept extends to communication within and between systems, examining how information flows and is processed to ensure effective control and feedback.
    
4. **Adaptation**: Cybernetics often deals with how systems adapt to their environments to survive, thrive, and fulfill their functions. This involves learning from past actions and modifying behaviors in response to external changes.
    
5. **Applications**: Originally developed in the context of mechanical and electrical engineering, cybernetics has broad applications across fields such as robotics, computer science, biology, psychology, and management. It offers valuable insights into system dynamics and has influenced theories in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.
