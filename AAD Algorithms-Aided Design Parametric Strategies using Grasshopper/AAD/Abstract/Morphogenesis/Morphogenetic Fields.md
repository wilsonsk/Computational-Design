# Morphogenetic Fields
![[Pasted image 20240708070643.png]]
Morphogenetic fields: the organizing fields of molecules, crystals and cells, tissues and indeed all bio systems. 
	There also exists organizing fields of social groups that influence behavior.
## Form
Is taken to include not only the shape of the outer surface or boundary of a system, but also its internal structure.
	If the mere description of any but the simplest static forms presents a mathematical problem of appalling complexity, the description of change of form—of morphogenesis—is even more difficult.
##### Closed System
A closed system is one that does not exchange matter or information with its surroundings. 
	All interactions occur within the system's boundaries, and no external inputs or outputs affect the system.
		*For example*: a computer processing data internally without any external input or output. The information within this system is self-contained.
In a closed system, the total amount of information is fixed.
	The system can transform or reorganize information internally, but it cannot gain new information from or lose information to the outside environment.
##### Open System
An open system is one that interacts with its environment, exchanging matter, energy, or information with external sources.
	These interactions can influence the system's state and behavior.
		*For example*: A communication system (like a telephone network) that sends and receives messages from outside sources.
An open system can gain new information from external inputs and can also lose information to the environment. 
	The flow of information is dynamic, and the system's information content can change over time.
### The Problem of Form
#### Catastrophe Theory
Rene' Thom's theory which describes the general typologies of "change of form" (i.e. "catastrophe").
	When Thom applies this theory to morphogenesis, where mathematical models attempt to calculate the final form of a system.
		The final form of a system is represented by an [[Data Relationships#Attractor|attractor]] within a morphogenetic field.
			Thom **postulates** that every object, or physical form, can be represented by such an attractor, that all morphogenesis:
				*“can be described by the disappearance of the attractors representing the initial forms, and their replacement by capture by the attractors representing the final forms."*
					Thom's hope was the eventual development of [[Topology|topological]] expressions that would correspond in detail to the actual morphogenetic processes.
						"But even so, these models would probably not enable quantitative predictions to be made. Their main value might lie in drawing attention to formal analogies between different types of morphogenesis."
#### The Limitations of Information Theory in Representing Form
##### Information Theory
Information Theory was developed by Claude Shannon, and focuses on quantifying the amount of uncertainty reduced when an event occurs.
- Imagine you are flipping a fair coin. Before you flip it, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.
- The information content of the coin flip is defined by the uncertainty about the outcome before the flip. Each possible outcome (heads or tails) has a probability of 1/2.
- When you flip the coin and observe the outcome (say, heads), the uncertainty is resolved. The information gained is based on the reduction of uncertainty from two possible outcomes to one actual outcome.
###### Binary Symbols and Yes/No Decisions
**Binary Representation**:
- Binary symbols (0 and 1) are used because they are the simplest way to encode information. Each bit (binary digit) can be seen as a yes/no decision.
- When determining the information content of a pattern, we count the number of binary decisions needed to specify it uniquely among a set of alternatives.
**Relating to Yes/No Decisions**:
- Consider a more detailed example: Identifying a number between 0 and 7.
- There are 8 possible numbers (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 in binary).
- To identify one specific number, you can ask a series of yes/no questions (binary decisions):
    1. Is the first bit 0? (Yes/No)
    2. Is the second bit 0? (Yes/No)
    3. Is the third bit 0? (Yes/No)
- Each yes/no question reduces the number of possible numbers by half. After 3 questions, you have uniquely identified one number out of 8.
**Uncertainty and Possible Alternatives**:
- The key idea is that the information content is linked to the uncertainty about which of the possible alternatives will occur.
- In the coin flip example, the uncertainty is between two alternatives (heads or tails). In the number example, the uncertainty is between 8 alternatives (the binary numbers from 0 to 7).
**Decision-Making Process**:
- The process of making yes/no decisions to identify an outcome is a way to measure the information content.
- Each decision reduces uncertainty. The total number of decisions required to fully resolve the uncertainty corresponds to the information content.
**Information Content and Alternatives**:
- The information content of an event is defined by the possible alternatives because it reflects the amount of uncertainty present before the event occurs.
**Binary Decisions**:
- Yes/no (binary) decisions are a method to quantify this uncertainty reduction. Each decision halves the number of possible alternatives, progressively narrowing down to the actual outcome.

Information Theory was originally developed by telephone engineers in connection with the transmission of messages from a source, through a channel, to a receiver.
	The main focus was on understanding how the characteristics of the channel affect the amount of information that can be transmitted in a given period.
		In a closed system, the amount of information received cannot exceed the amount of information sent.
			The amount of information in an event is not determined by the actual outcome alone, but by the range of possible outcomes that could have occurred. 
				**Information measures how much uncertainty was present before the outcome was known.**
Although, information can change form (e.g., from Morse code to words), but the total information remains the same.
- **Message in Morse Code**: "HELLO"
- **Possible Symbols**: Each letter can be represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes (Morse code).
1. **Before Decoding**:
    - There are many possible sequences of dots and dashes that could represent different letters.
    - The uncertainty is high because there are many possible combinations.
2. **Decoding the Message**:
    - To decode "HELLO", you systematically identify each letter through a series of binary decisions:
        - Is the first symbol a dot or a dash? (Yes/No)
        - Is the second symbol a dot or a dash? (Yes/No)
        - And so on for each letter in the message.
3. **Resolving Uncertainty**:
    - Each yes/no decision reduces the number of possible symbols until the entire message "HELLO" is identified.

For example, when flipping a coin, the information content is not just in the result (heads or tails) but also in the fact that there were two possible outcomes.
	Binary symbols (0 and 1) are often used to represent information because they are the simplest form of encoding decisions.
		A pattern's information content is determined by how many binary (yes/no) decisions are required to specify it uniquely from a set of known patterns.
			To understand the information content of a pattern, we need to determine how many binary decisions are necessary to identify it from a group of possible patterns.
				Each binary decision narrows down the possibilities by half.
##### Limitations of Information Theory in Biological Systems
In biology this theory has some relevance to the quantitative study of the transmission of impulses by nerve fibers; to a lesser extent it has a bearing on the transmission of a sequence of bases in the DNA of parents to the DNA of their offspring, although even in such a simple case as this it can be seriously misleading, because in living organisms things happen that do not occur in telephone wires: genes mutate, parts of chromosomes undergo inversions, translocations, etc. 
	But Information Theory is not relevant to biological morphogenesis: it applies only to the transmission of information within closed systems, and it cannot allow for an increase in the content of information during this process. 
		 Developing organisms are not closed systems, and as they develop the complexity of form and organization increases.
			  Although biologists often speak of “genetic information” and “positional information” as if these terms have some well-defined meaning, this is an illusion: they borrow only the jargon of Information Theory and leave its rigor behind.
				 
  However, even if impressively detailed mathematical models of morphogenetic processes could be made by whatever method, and even if they gave rise to predictions that agreed with experimental evidence, **there would still be the question of what these models correspond to**.
	  The same question is raised by the correspondence between mathematical models and empirical observations in any branch of science.
#### Tendency to Search for Logic in Numbers
The tendency of the mind to seek and find order in experience: the ordered structures of mathematics, creations of the human mind, are superimposed onto experience, and those that do not fit are discarded; thus by a process resembling natural selection, those mathematical formulae that fit best are retained. 
	In this view, scientific activity is concerned only with the development and empirical testing of mathematical models of more or less isolated and definable aspects of the world; it cannot lead to any fundamental understanding of reality.

Pythagorean type: the universe is dependent upon a fundamental mathematical order that somehow gives rise to all empirical phenomena; this transcendent order is revealed and becomes comprehensible only through the methods of mathematics. 
	Although this attitude is rarely advocated explicitly, it has a strong influence within modern science, and can often be found, more or less thinly disguised, among mathematicians and physicists
#### Fundamental Form
**Sheldrake** believes form does not need to be understood or explained in terms of numbers, but in terms of "Fundamental Forms".

**Plato** described the forms of experiential reality to be "imperfect reflections" of "non physical" **archetypal** forms or ideas. 
	But this doctrine, strongly influenced by the mysticism of the Pythagoreans, failed to explain how the eternal Forms were related to the changing world of phenomena.

**Aristotle** believed this problem could be overcome by regarding the forms of things as immanent/inherent (i.e. existing within or operating within), rather than transcendent: 
	Specific forms were inherent in the souls of living beings and actually caused them to take up their characteristic forms.

In **Driesch**’s system, which was explicitly based on that of Aristotle, the specific forms of living organisms were caused by a nonenergetic agency, entelechy.
	The morphogenetic fields and chreodes of organismic biologists play a similar role in guiding morphogenetic processes toward specific final forms. 
		But their nature has so far remained obscure.
###### The Realm of Possibility
This obscurity may be due, in part, to the Platonic tendency of much organismic thought, most clearly apparent in Whitehead’s system of philosophy. 
	**Whitehead** postulated that all actual events involved what he called Eternal Objects; the latter collectively made up **the realm of possibility**, and **included all possible forms**; indeed, they strongly resembled Platonic Forms. 
		But clearly, a metaphysical notion of morphogenetic fields as aspects of Platonic Forms or Eternal Objects would be of little value to experimental science.
			 Only if they are regarded as physical entities that have physical effects can they help to provide a scientific understanding of morphogenesis.

The organismic philosophy embraces both biology and physics; hence, if morphogenetic fields are assumed to play a causal role in biological morphogenesis, they should also play a causal role in the morphogenesis of simpler systems such as crystals and molecules.
	Such fields are not recognized in the existing theories of physics.
		 Therefore it is important to consider to what extent these existing theories are capable of explaining the morphogenesis of purely chemical systems.
			  If they are able to provide an adequate explanation, then the idea of morphogenetic fields is unnecessary; but if they are not, the way lies open for a new hypothesis of the causation of form through morphogenetic fields in both biological and nonbiological systems.
## Form and Energy
In Newtonian physics, all causation was seen in terms of energy, the principle of movement and change. All moving things have energy— the kinetic energy of moving bodies, thermal vibration and electromagnetic radiation—and this energy can cause other things to move.
	Static things may also have energy—potential energy—due to their tendency to move; they are static only because they are restrained by forces that oppose this tendency.
#### The Electromagnetic Field
An electromagnetic field is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects.
	This field affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field.

**Components**: The electromagnetic field is composed of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$.

**[[Mapping#Spatial Fields as a Subset of Functions|Function Mapping]]**:
- The electric field $\mathbf{E}(x, y, z, t)$ maps each point in space and time to a vector that represents the electric force per unit charge at that point.
- The magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(x, y, z, t)$ maps each point in space and time to a vector that represents the magnetic force per unit charge at that point.
###### Localization of Electrical Charges:
- Electrical charges (like electrons and protons) exist at specific locations within this field.
- These charges are not spread out continuously but are instead confined to certain points or regions.
- Think of charges as being at specific spots within a larger, spread-out electromagnetic field. These charges do not fill the entire field but are confined to particular areas.
###### Propagation of Electromagnetic Radiation:
- Electromagnetic radiation (like light) propagates through the electromagnetic field as waves or vibrational disturbances.
- According to quantum theory, these disturbances can also be described as particle-like photons, which are discrete packets (quanta) of energy.
- The field itself supports the movement of electromagnetic waves, which can also be described as particles (photons) according to quantum mechanics.
#### Quantum Field Theory
This theory extends the concept to matter fields, where subatomic particles (like electrons and protons) are considered excitations of their respective fields.
	Each type of particle is a quantum of a specific field (e.g., electrons are quanta of the electron-positron field).
		In this framework, each particle type is an excitation of a corresponding field, and the particles themselves are localized phenomena within these fields.

**Fields as Operators**: In QFT, fields are treated as operator-valued functions that act on a quantum state.
$$\LARGE ψ(x,t)$$
**Field Quantization**: Fields are quantized, meaning that the field values at each point in space-time can be thought of as operators that create or annihilate particles.
**Electromagnetic Field (Quantum Electrodynamics)**:
- The electromagnetic field is quantized, and its quanta are photons.
- The field operator $\hat{A}_\mu(x)$ maps each point in space-time to an operator that can create or annihilate photons.
**Matter Fields**:
- For each type of particle (e.g., electrons, quarks), there is a corresponding field.
- An electron field $\psi(x)$, for example, maps each point in space-time to an operator that can create or annihilate electrons.
##### Visualization
Imagine an ocean with buoys (charges) floating at specific spots. 
	The ocean represents the electromagnetic field, which is continuous and spread out. The buoys are localized within the ocean, meaning they exist at specific points rather than being spread throughout the entire ocean.
		 Waves (electromagnetic radiation) travel through the ocean, moving between and around the buoys. 
			 Quantum field theory adds that each buoy type (e.g., electron, proton) corresponds to its own specific type of wave pattern in the ocean.

By understanding "localized" in this way, you can see how specific charges or particles exist at definite points within a larger, continuous field.
#### The Issue of Ordering or [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#"Space" vs. "Spatial"|Spatial]]
Causes vs. Energetic Causes 
In these theories, physical phenomena are explained by a combination of fields and of energy, not in terms of energy alone. 
	Thus although energy can be regarded as the cause of change, the ordering of change depends on the spatial structure of the fields. 
		These structures have physical effects, but they are not in themselves a type of energy; they act as “geometrical” or spatial causes. 
			The radical difference between this idea and the notion of exclusively energetic causation is illustrated in the contrast between Newton’s and Einstein’s theories of gravitation: according to Newton, the Moon moves around the Earth because it is pulled toward it by an attractive force; according to Einstein, it does so because the very space in which it moves is curved.
### Schrödinger Equation and Electromagnetism (Orbitals of Electrons)
Within an electromagnetic field, electrical charges are localized, and through which electromagnetic radiations propagate as vibrational disturbances. 
	According to quantum theory, these disturbances are particle-like photons associated with discrete quanta of energy. 
		Third, in the quantum field theory of matter, subatomic particles are quanta of excitation of matter fields. 
			Each kind of particle has its own [[Fields|field]]: a proton is a quantum of the proton-antiproton field, an electron a quantum of the electron-positron field, and so on.

The possible ways in which the atoms can combine together are given by the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics, which enables the orbitals of electrons to be calculated in terms of probabilities; in the quantum field theory of matter these orbitals can be regarded as structures within the electron-positron field. 
	But since electrons and atomic nuclei are electrically charged, they are also associated with spatial patterns within the electromagnetic field, and hence with potential energies.
		 Not all the possible spatial arrangements of a given number of atoms have the same potential energy, and only the arrangement with the lowest potential energy will be stable.
			![[Pasted image 20240729072635.png]]
				If a system is in a state that has a higher energy than possible alternative states, any small displacement (for example, due to thermal agitation) will cause it to move into another state (A).
					If it is in a state with a lower energy than possible alternatives, after small displacements it will return to this state, which is consequently stable (B). 
						A system may also exist temporarily in a state that is not the most stable so long as it is not displaced above the level of a “barrier” (C); when this happens, it will move into a stabler, lower-energy state.

These energetic considerations determine which is the most stable state of a chemical structure, but they do not account for its spatial characteristics, which in figure 6 are represented by the slopes down which the ball rolls, and that act as barriers confining it.
	These depend on spatial patterns given by the fields of matter and electromagnetism.
