# Computational Design Thinking
Achim Menges

Nature itself (the evolutionary force) is a computational thinking entity in that it optimizes in response to environment through iteration - seemingly intentionally as it organizes.

In this abstract mindset, the designer acts similarly to the process of natural selection, iteratively testing and refining geometric components and their assemblies to achieve optimal forms. This process is guided by the principles of efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability, with the final form emerging as a response to environmental constraints and functional requirements. 
## The generation of form
*The manifest form - that which appears - is the result of a computational interaction between the internal rules and external (morphogenetic) pressures that, themselves, originate in other adjacent forms (ecology). The (pre-concrete) internal rules comprise, in their activity, an embedded form, what is today clearly understood and described by the term algorithm.* - [Sanford Kwinter](https://egs.edu/biography/sanford-kwinter/)
### The "internal rules":
Refer to the "embedded" algorithms that control, manage, and manipulate the **parameters** of a system. Which influence the morphology of a system.
	- The "genetic" (i.e. "*hardwired*") component.
	- **The rules of the subset of the "ecology" system. (i.e. that of an individual sub-system).**
### The "external pressures":
That also influence the morphology of a system, that seemingly exist as "adjacent forms" refer to the "environmental conditions" and relationships between "it" and seemingly external systems.
	- The "environment" (i.e. dynamic and external) component. 
	- **The rules of the subset of the "universal" system (i.e. that of a group of interdependent *individual* sub-systems).**
### The universal rules of physics:
Are the super set containing both components.
### The morphology:
Refers to the resulting form of an individual or ecological system (interdependent group).

*The fundamental concepts which underlie computational theory and techniques expose **form as a subsidiary component of environment**, and **environment as a complex web of energies in dynamic exchange of both regeneration and degeneration**.* - Achim Menges
## Computation in design represents an accumulation of multilayered concepts:
- Systems theory
- Cybernetics: advanced the notion of systems theory to address the new existence of the man-machine relationship
- Morphogenesis 
- Developmental biology
The initial foundations of these concepts:
- Biology
- Mathematics
- Computer Science
- Systems Science
- Philosophy

These concepts and their contemporary translations are applied to architectural design.
- Architecture: 
	- The careful or complex designed structure of something.
## Computation vs Computerization
### Algorithms
A set of procedures for consisting of a finite number of rules, which define a succession of operations for the solution of a given problem.
	I.e. It is a finite sequence of explicit, elementary instructions described in an exact, complete yet general manner. 
### Computerization
Only ever contains as much information as is supplied.
Methods that simply compile or associate given values or set of values.
Entities or processes that are already conceptualized in the designer's mind are entered, manipulated, or stored on a computer system.

An object based strategy of encapsulating information into symbolic representations. 
	That is, methods of organizing information.
### Computation
Methods that deduce results from values or sets of values.
Enables specific data to be realized out of an initial abstraction - in the form of codes which encapsulates values and actions. 
#### Computation in the context of architectural practice, theory and technology
In 1960, saw the first developments of graphical systems for designing w/ computers.
	Initially the premise was to mimic the predictive possibilities being practiced in structural engineering. 
		The constraints, requirements and intentions the defined an architectural problem, represented the challenges that prevented optimization as a primary objective.
##### Automated Vision:
Was a holistic perspective of computer program that could output specific architectural solutions by processing complex design briefs as inputs.
	Which lead to the **question**:
		How can or should a computer simulate **human thought processes and creativity**.
			Cybernetics would be considered as a source of ideas. 
				As it was focused on how to computers could be utilized to **expand** human intelligence, rather than to be utilized for simply processing.
	To address this question, a new perspective on design/architecture was generated:
		That of [[Abstract Concept|abstracting]] the human thinking process (i.e. the devising, the act of formulation) of architecture, as a **system** itself. 
			Implying relationships between components which produce structures. 
				Where the devising, the act of formulation, occurs through the understanding and subsequent development of complex interdependent relationships between components: not only material components, but the human components (i.e. variables) involved in social engagement and user interaction, the components of form generation and form finding/shaping, and the components of space and structure. 
##### Systems-based approaches (software)
In the 1960's Sketchpad, GRASP and LOKAT were developed. 

###### GRASPH
Developed by Eric Teicholz at Harvard's Graduate School of Design.
	A generative system utilizing structural, solar exposure and programmatic constraints and form-making procedures to implemented space planning.

###### LOKAT
Developed also at HSD
	Implemented evaluation into the algorithms that defined "good fit", which was a function of program associations and proximity variables. 
###### Sketchpad
Developed by Ivan Sutherland at MIT.
	Implemented the notion of **constraints** (i.e. the specific equations that constrain or bound the values of variables in order to satisfy the equations) and **parameters** (i.e. free variables). 
		Introduced an interface, and methods for maintaining rule-based geometric associations.
			Was notable for its ability to define fundamental computational methods:
				Parametrics, associativity, and rule-based systems generation. 

**Sketchpad extracted the logic** of **identifying interrelated geometries**, and the **objective causality between these interdependent geometries** that **controls** and thus **determines** the **development of form**.  
###### The Synthesis of Process as a as a Model
Most importantly, it produced a new perspective of relationship between human thinking and computational processing, and the generation of process itself all obtained as a result of the system. 
	Abstractly, **the process itself** of the **construction of a drawing within Sketchpad** was a **model** of **the design process**. 
		The specified **positions** of **[[Elemental Building Blocks|elementary objects]] ([[Points#Vertices|vertices]] and [[Grids#Edge Definition|edges]])** **modelled** the **[[Parameters|parameters]]** of **design**.
			The **geometric constraints, and [[Data Relationships|relationships]] applied** to these **elementary** **objects** **modelled** the **design constraints** which **[[Data Relationships#Each defining different outcomes based on specific constraints or conditions.|bound the values]] of the design variables**. 
				And thus define the structure which is composed of these relating elementary objects. 

Its Expression in Architectural Theory:
As a **[[Digital Informing Creativity#The Computational Design Paradigm|paradigm shift]]**:
	From the **view of architecture** as a **material object**.
		Symbolic representation of physical elements adjacently to each other.
	To the **view of architecture** as an **[[Data Management#Abstractions (i.e. a set)|abstractions]]**, a **system composed of and working with series of interdependent component systems** (i.e. structures, objects).
		A holistic structure composed of forces, pressures and constraints that generate form.
