# Computational Methodology
## Involves the following four steps:
1. Decomposition:
	1. Breaking something into smaller parts.
2. Pattern Recognition:
	1. Look for similarities, trends, and patterns.
3. Abstraction:
	1. Focus on whatâ€™s important and ignore what is unnecessary.
4. Algorithmic Thinking:
	1. Create step-by-step instructions to solve the problem.

## Decomposition
Very general method: Parametric/Computational Analysis
1. Observe system/object.
2. Abstract the system/object being observed.
	1. Decomposition of the sets of geometries.
3. Identify and extract the critical parameters.
4. Implement the critical parameters into the computational design model

### Abstracting a Geometry aka [[Rationalizing a Geometry]]
Refers to the process of simplifying complex geometric forms into a series of manageable, quantifiable, and often repeatable elements that can be more easily analyzed, constructed, or fabricated.
- The abstract mindset or perspective in this context involves viewing architectural forms not as monolithic wholes but as assemblages of discrete, parametrically defined components.

## Identifying Key Parameters of the Geometry
### 1. **Core Functionality and Purpose Identification**

- **Direct Observation**: Start by observing the primary function and purpose of the design. Ask, "What is this design fundamentally trying to achieve?"
- **Intuitive Simplification**: Use intuition to strip the design down to its most basic functional requirements. Consider which elements are absolutely necessary for the design to fulfill its purpose.

### 2. **Environmental Interaction Analysis**

- **Contextual Factors**: Consider how the design interacts with its environment. This includes physical factors (like wind, light, and gravity) and social factors (like user flow and interaction).
- **Adaptive Elements**: Intuitively identify which parts of the design might need to adapt to these factors. These become prime candidates for parameterization.

### 3. **Structural Considerations**

- **Load Path Visualization**: Mentally visualize how forces travel through the design. Elements in this load path are key to the design's structural integrity and thus important parameters.
- **Material and Method Constraints**: Think about the materials and construction methods to be used. Consider which geometrical or dimensional aspects are constrained by these choices.

### 4. **Aesthetic and Spatial Experience**

- **Dominant Visual Themes**: Identify the dominant visual themes or experiences intended in the design. Parameters that control these aspects can greatly affect the design's aesthetic appeal.
- **User Interaction and Flow**: Consider how users will move through or interact with the space. Parameters affecting paths, viewpoints, and user interfaces are crucial.

### 5. **Modularity and Repetition**

- **Repetitive Elements Identification**: Look for patterns or repetitive elements in the design. These often signify underlying parameters that dictate the repetition rate, spacing, or scaling.
- **Modularity as a Parameter**: For modular designs, the dimensions and interfaces of modules are key parameters for ensuring fit and function.

### 6. **Flexibility and Adaptability**

- **Change Anticipation**: Consider which aspects of the design are most likely to need changes during further development. These areas should be parameterized for ease of adjustment.
- **Scalability**: Identify dimensions or elements that might need to scale up or down. Parameters controlling these aspects can provide flexibility in adapting the design to unforeseen requirements.

### Developing an Intuitive Heuristic:

- **Reflective Practice**: Regularly engage in reflective practice, analyzing past design projects to understand which parameters ended up being key to successful outcomes.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Inspiration**: Look to other fields (e.g., biology, engineering) for principles that dictate form and function. Nature, for instance, optimizes structures and forms efficiently, guiding intuition towards key functional parameters.
- **Iterative Experimentation**: Use parametric tools to experiment with different parameters on smaller scale projects. This hands-on approach can sharpen intuition about which aspects of a design are most impactful when varied.

By integrating these strategies, designers develop an intuitive heuristic for identifying key variables that balance the logical with the creative, ensuring that parametric models are both functionally effective and aesthetically meaningful. This heuristic is personal and evolves with experience, becoming a powerful tool in the designer's toolkit for tackling complex design challenges.
## Rational Geometry Vs Non-Rational Geometry

[[Grids|Grids]] which define edges, edges which are then transformed, and a surface that is generated between the original edges and the new transformed edges
## Form Finding
Form finding refers to the process of discovering the shape of a physical structure through the exploration of its equilibrium under specific conditions and forces. It's a concept rooted deeply in both architecture and engineering, where the optimal form of a structure is determined not solely by aesthetic preference but by how it naturally responds to physical forces, such as gravity, tension, compression, and environmental factors.

This process often results in shapes that are efficient, structurally sound, and sometimes mimic natural forms, reflecting the principle that form follows function. The idea is to allow the structure's material and environmental conditions to guide the determination of its shape, leading to designs that are inherently optimized for their intended purpose.
