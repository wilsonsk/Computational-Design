# Reality
The foundation is absolute, i.e. no differetiation.
	Then comes the introduction of relational existence, that is equality and thus inequality.
		This is a constraint imposed upon the absolute.
			Further constraints are imposed in the form of more complex equations (and functions which are types of equations).
				These give rise to more complex relationships and thus higher level components.
