## The Relationship Between the Tools used to Investigate the Subject, the Understanding of the Subject, and the Mental Process of Designing
Is a in a constant, dynamic process of dialogue.
### Tools
#### Theoretical Research
[[Language|Language]] is the fundamental parameter of thought.
	I.e. The thinking expresses a process of language. 
	
Theories of perspective systems were a catalyst for the disruption in the status quo of how space was visualized and thought about, articulated and organized.

Similarly, the "Parallel Rules" that defined the Modernist Movement, triggered a revolution in the principles of ornate style. 
	Emphasized functionality, which derived form. 
	Embraced industry and technology, showcasing the materials as part of the design. 
	Manufacturing was a considered variable in the design process.
	Integration with environment. 
	Minimal.
	Rational use of light and space.
#### [[Computational Design Thinking#Computation in the context of architectural practice, theory and technology|Technology]]
The theoretical as a parameter of the tools. 
	I.e. The tools express a process of thinking. 
##### [[Computational Design Thinking|Computational Design]] as a Tool
A tool that facilitates an engagement with generative systems.
	Generative systems being generic code based systems, able to generate themselves in a dynamic and adaptive way.
		The generation of the systems is a function of (i.e. defined by) their [[Parameters|parameters]] and the [[Computational Design Thinking#The Synthesis of Process as a as a Model|constraints of the parameters]].

#### Understanding
##### Computational Design as an Understanding
Enables the a new understanding and subsequent redefinition of [[Elemental Building Blocks|elementary objects]], shapes, forms, configurations and organizational systems as [[Data Relationships|relational]].
	I.e. The tools express a way of thinking relationally about components and structures. 
		And thus, the products of this coupling, are new aesthetics of relation, and "aesthetics of sublime/legible forces.
		  **Aesthetics of Sublime**
			  Is derived by an aesthetic that is the result of forces applied into a generative system, which are "legible" in the configurations and variations resulting from the system itself.
			  **Overwhelming Scale and Space**: 
				  Modern architecture often employs scale and spatial dynamics in ways that can evoke a sense of the sublime. This could be through vast, open interiors that dwarf human scale, or through structures that dominate landscapes or cityscapes. The sheer size and scope can evoke feelings of awe and smallness in the individual, akin to the traditional natural sublime.
			  **Interaction with Natural Forces**: 
				  Modern architecture may also engage directly with natural elements — sunlight, wind, vistas — in a manner that emphasizes their power and the human experience of confronting these forces. Buildings might be designed to not just withstand these forces but to highlight and interact with them, making the invisible (like wind patterns or the path of the sun) visible and tangible.
		**Aesthetics of Legible Forces**
			**Visibility of Structural Elements**: 
				- In contrast to styles that conceal structural elements, many modern and contemporary buildings make these elements visible. This transparency about how a building stands and holds itself against gravitational and environmental forces can be seen as making the 'forces' legible. For example, the visible beams, columns, and other structural supports articulate the flow of forces through the building, making these dynamics part of the aesthetic experience.
			**Expressive Material Use**:
				- Materials are chosen not just for functional reasons but for their ability to convey these forces. The reflective surface of a skyscraper might capture and play with light, or glass might be used extensively to create a feeling of exposure and vulnerability, enhancing the interaction between indoor and outdoor environments.

##### Computational Design expresses a relational way of thinking:
Thereby, facilitating the management of complexities that arise from diverse and ever changing society and environment, that has a multitude of individuals and groups each with their own unique perspectives and needs. 

In contrast, there are many designs not relevant to the complexities of our complex human system.
	The most pertinent way to explicate (i.e. analyze and develop) the need and role of a designer:
		That is - the creative intent (mind) of the designer to make choices. 
			The subsequent [[#The Computational Design Paradigm|paradigm]] hinges on the role of the designer to make creative decisions about the relationships between the parameters that generate the outcomes of the these complex systems.

### The Mental Process of Design
#### The Computational Design Paradigm
Design is fundamentally relational even before form. 
	I.e. [[Tradition vs. Algorithmic Modeling#Associative Logic of Computational and Parametric Design|Associative logic]]

This paradigm implies a separation between designer and technical operator. 
	Both being valid but distinct.

#### Parameters of Evaluating the Computational Design Aesthetic
The definitions of these parameters are theoretically abstract, preceding their implementation.
They are fundamental considerations prior to the construction or generation of a form.
	They serve to inform the the design **process**. 
##### The Computational Design tools apply these abstract definitions to generate forms and aesthetics.
Making the design a technical and "creative" or conceptual endeavor. 
	And emphasizing these parameters as principles.

Therefore, these parameters (i.e. principles) and the parameters define the Computational Design aesthetic, and also are inherent to the setup of the generative systems themselves. 
	Meaning, the visual and functional outcomes of a design are predetermined by the parameters and their relationships defined within the system.
		To leverage the true potential of the Computational Design system, Designers must engage with these parameters and relationships at a fundamental level. 
##### Variations: 
In computational design, variations refer to the different outcomes that can be generated by altering parameters within a design system. These could include changes in shape, size, pattern, or color, among other attributes. In generative design, variations are often used to explore a wide range of design possibilities automatically generated by algorithms based on set rules or constraints.
##### Inflection:
In the context of computational design, inflection can refer to points of change or deviation in a form or pattern. This might be where a surface bends or folds, or where the direction or character of a design element shifts. It's a subtle but important concept that can greatly influence the dynamic of a design, adding complexity or focus to certain areas.
##### Self-Similarity:
This is a concept borrowed from fractal geometry where a pattern is recursive, meaning the overall structure is made up of smaller versions of itself. In design, self-similarity can be used to create complex, visually appealing patterns that maintain a cohesive aesthetic at various scales. This can be particularly powerful in architectural or textile design, where patterns that repeat in a self-similar manner can add a sense of unity and harmony.
##### Integrations:
In computational design, integrations refer to how different parts of a design system work together holistically. This could involve how different structural elements support each other, how various materials are combined, or how different aesthetic elements complement each other. Effective integration ensures that the various components of a design are not only functional but also aesthetically cohesive.
