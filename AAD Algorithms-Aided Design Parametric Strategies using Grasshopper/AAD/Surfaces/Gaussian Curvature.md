# Gaussian Curvature: *G*=*k<sub>1</sub>* *  *k<sub>2</sub>* 

## Is the **measure** of the curvature of a surface at a point:
It is obtained by multiplying the surface's two principal curvatures (k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>) at that point. 

The result describes the intrinsic curvature of the surface, independent of how the surfaces is oriented in space. 
## Developable Surfaces: 
### Zero Principal Curvature:
- Are **Surfaces** with **null** Gaussian Curvature **at all points of that surface** are **Developable Surfaces**:
	- Specific type of surfaces that have a Gaussian curvature of **zero** at **every point** on that surface. 
	- This means that at least one of the **principal curvatures** at point is zero (i.e. zero product law), making the surface **locally** flat at every point.
	- Are **composed** of **linear cross sections** in one primary direction.
		- i.e. they only curve in **one direction** at any point (perpendicular to the generatrix).
			- This curvature is captured as the Maximum Principal Curvature. 
	- Therefore, they are **always** **Ruled Surfaces** - that is a surface generated by a the motion **of** a straight line (the straight line being the **generatrix** or **ruling**). 
### Minimum Principal Curvature *k<sub>1</sub>***:
- Corresponds to the **generatrix** *g* (*mostly applicable to developable surfaces*). 
	- Because the **surface does not curve along the direction of the generatrix** (i.e. the generatrix of a developable surface is a straight line).
		- Instead it is flat in that direction.
- Since the generatrix *g* is a **ruled/straight** line, *k<sub>1</sub> = 0*.
### Maximum Principal Curvature *k<sub>2</sub>***:
- Corresponds to *d'* which is **parallel** to the **directrix *d*** (*mostly applicable to developable surfaces*).
	- Because the maximal curvature is found in a direction **perpendicular** to the generatrix. **Thus naturally aligning with the directrix.** 
- Since *d'* is a **circle** its curvature *k<sub>2</sub>* has a **constant value** equal to the **reciprocal** of the cylinder's **radius**.

### Unrollability: 
- The surface has the **property** to be unrolled onto a plane without distortion.
	- I.e. they can be **flattened** onto a plane without deformation (stretching, compressing, or tearing). 
		- They are practical in manufacturing and fabrication because forms can be constructed by bending flat sheets of flexible materials (metal, cardboard, plywood, etc.)
		- Additionally, these surfaces contain a **set** of **straight line** which also simplify the structure's constructions (linear beams).
### Examples of **Developable Surfaces**:
- Planes, cylinders, cones, and surfaces obtained by bending a flat sheet without stretching it. These surfaces are characterized by **straight lines**, called **generators** or **rulings** that lie entirely on the surface.
### Sign of Gaussian Curvature

##### Undevelopable Surfaces can have a **positive** or **negative** Gaussian Curvature value.
Using basic Operational Properties:
###### Positive Gaussian Curvature
It is positive when principal curvature values, *K<sub>1</sub>* and *K<sub>2</sub>,* have the **same** *signs*: are both *negative* or both *positive*.
	- Implying that the curves *C<sub>1</sub>* and *C<sub>2</sub>* (of the *K<sub>1</sub>* and *K<sub>2</sub>* values for a given point *P*) have their associated **osculating circles** lying on the **same** side of the **generatrix/surface**. 
	- A **positive** value means the **surface shape** is **convex**, locally dome-shaped (like a sphere) at point *P*.
###### Negative Gaussian Curvature
It is **negative** when principal curvature values, *K<sub>1</sub>* and *K<sub>2</sub>,* have **opposite** *signs*: one is  *negative* and the other is *positive* (or vice versa).
	- Implying that the curves *C<sub>1</sub>* and *C<sub>2</sub>* (of the *K<sub>1</sub>* and *K<sub>2</sub>* values for a given point *P*) have their associated **osculating circles** lying on the **opposite** sides of the **generatrix/surface** (i.e. one oscualting circle is "under" or "outside" the surface while the other is not). 
	- A **negative** value means the **surface shape** is **concave**, locally saddle-shaped at point *P*.
###### Null Gaussian Curvature
If Gaussian Curvature value is **null**, then (in this example case) **C<sub>2</sub>*** is a **straight line**.
