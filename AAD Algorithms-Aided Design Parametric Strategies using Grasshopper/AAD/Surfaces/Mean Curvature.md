# Mean Curvature: (*k<sub>1</sub>* +  *k<sub>2</sub>*) / 2
## Minimal Surfaces:
Surfaces that have a **null** Mean Curvature value at **all points on that surface**.

### A **Minimal Surface** has ***M=0***, meaning ***k<sub>1</sub>=-k<sub>2</sub>***.
I.e. The **Minimal Principal Curvature** and the **Maximum Principal Curvature**** have the **same** **value** and **opposite** **signs** at **each point** on the surface.
	
**For example:** *a **catenoid** minimal surface, formed by the **revolution** of a catenary-curve g about its directrix d*
	*g* has **positive curvature**, that is, its **osculating circle** on the **positive side** of the **generatrix**. I.e. its osculating circle in "on" the surface. 
	*d* (which is a circle) has **negative curvature** by definition. I.e. its osculating circle is "outside" the surface, on the "negative side" of the generatrix.

*A soap film enclosing no volume and that is formed between boundary constraints is a minimal surface.*
	*it has a **vanishing mean curvature** because the surface area is constantly **approaching a minimal surface area.***
