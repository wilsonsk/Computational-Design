# Mean Curvature: (*k<sub>1</sub>* +  *k<sub>2</sub>*) / 2
## Minimal Surfaces:
Surfaces that have a **null** Mean Curvature value at **all points on that surface**.
### A **Minimal Surface** has ***M=0***, meaning ***k<sub>1</sub>=-k<sub>2</sub>***.
I.e. The **[[Notion of Surface Curvature#The curve in which the **Minimal Principal** **curvature *k<sub>1</sub>*** is calculated is called ***C<sub>1</sub>***|Minimal Principal Curvature]]** and the **[[Notion of Surface Curvature#The curve in which **Maximum Principal curvature *k<sub>2</sub>*** is calculated is called ***C<sub>2</sub>***|Maximum Principal Curvature]]**** have the **same** **value** and **opposite** **signs** at **each point** on the surface.
	
**For example:** *a **catenoid** minimal surface, formed by the **revolution** of a [[Digital Form-Finding#Catenary Curve|catenary curve]] g about its directrix d*
	*g* has **positive curvature**, that is, its **osculating circle** on the **positive side** of the **generatrix**. I.e. its osculating circle in "on" the surface. 
	*d* (which is a circle) has **negative curvature** by definition. I.e. its osculating circle is "outside" the surface, on the "negative side" of the generatrix.

*A soap film enclosing no volume and that is formed between boundary constraints is a minimal surface.*
	*It has a **vanishing mean curvature** because the surface area is constantly **approaching a minimal surface area.*** 
### Zero Mean Curvature
A surface where at every point, the average of the [[Notion of Surface Curvature#**Principal Curvatures**|principal curvatures]] is zero.
	$H = (k_1 +k_2)/2) = 0

These surfaces behave as though the forces acting perpendicularly to the surface are balanced. 
	In a soap film, spanning some boundary, the forces due to surface tension in the film balance out in such a way that the mean curvature of the film surface is zero. 
		This makes soap film a minimal surface, i.e. one that adopts a shape that minimizes surface area while maintaining the boundary constraints. 
A surface that is neither convex nor concave at any point.
