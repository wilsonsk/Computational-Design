# Surfaces
## Parametric Representation of a surface
^parametric-representation-of-a-surface
### Local Coordinate System:
Just like curves, surfaces can also be represented by the LCS.
- Defines geometry and manipulation, relative to itself. 
	- For example, moving a points along a surface without referencing the global coordinate system.
- Where in curves represented in the LCS require just one parameter *t*, surfaces require **two parameters** *u* and *v*, their values ranging from 0 and 1.
	- *u* and *v* are **scalars of vectors**, whose **linear combinations** can reach any point on a plane or surface. 
		- *u* Axis: Runs "horizontally" across a surface.
		- *v* Axis Runs "vertically" across a surface.

- For each **value** *u* in the **set** {u}, the points *P(u1,v)* compose the **sectional curve** *C1*. (i.e. scaling u while **holding v constant**).
	- *By scaling on parameter and holding the other constant, a curve (specifically, an Isocurve) is generated.* 
- And, for each **value** v in the **set** {v}, the points *P(u,v1)* compose the **sectional curve** *C2*. (i.e. scaling v while **holding u constant**).
	- *By scaling on parameter and holding the other constant, a curve (specifically, an Isocurve) is generated.* 
- Curves *C1* and *C2* are **defined** as **Isocurves** or **Isoparametric Curves**. 
	- Specifically, *C1* and *C2* are the **isocurves** of a surface *S* at *P(u1,v1)*. 
	- *C1* isocurves are the curves that are **parallel** to **U**.
	- *C2* isocurves are the curves that are parallel to **V**.

### Isocurves/Isoparametric Curves:
A curve **[[Surface Analysis#Extracting the Surfaces Isocurves/Isoparametric Curves Isocurves (i.e. the curves)|extracted]]** from a surface.
- That represents a constant value along one of the surface's parameter directions (typically in *uv* parameters/coordinates).
#### *Equal Parameters*:
Refers to **isoparametric curve**.
	- Referring to the equality in parameters across the dimensions of an entity or process.
		- Enabling precise control, analysis and representation. 

Is a curve of **constant value** in the **parameter space** of a **surface**.
- I.e. Where one parameter remains constant while the other varies.
	- *For example*:
		- An isoparametric curve along a surface could be one where the *u* is held constant and the *v* varies (or vice versa).
			- This generates a curve that flows across the surface following the surface's inherent geometric properties.

In the context of **NURBS surfaces**:
- Isocurves are used to indicate the **underlying parametric nature** of the surfaces.

**Constant Parameter Curves**: 
Isocurves are generated by holding either *u* or *v* constant while varying the other parameter. 
- I.e. Represent constant values along one parameter while varying along the other.
This produces:
- **U-isocurves**: Curves obtained by fixing *v* and varying *u*. These run in the direction that �u increases.
- **V-isocurves**: Curves obtained by fixing *u* and varying *v*. These run in the direction that �v increases.

Purpose:
- Help in understanding the shape, form and flow of a surface.
	- Allow designers to assess curvature, continuity and other geometric properties of the surface.
- They do not necessarily correspond to the geometric features on the surface.
	- But are indicative of the surface's parametric definition.

- They are curves with **constant** *u* or *v* values on a surface.
- Isocurves create a rectangular "grid" generalizing the notion of the Cartesian Grid on a curved surface. 
	- This concept is **valid** for **every** freeform surface because a **NURBS-surface** can always be thought of as the **deformation** of a **flat-rectangular surface**. 
	- Surfaces have **bidimensional domains** also called **domain^2** with defined *u* and *v* axes. 
		![[Pasted image 20240323102612.png|600]]
	- **Non-rectangular surfaces** are based on **rectangular grids**.
		- Can be visualized by drawing a surface from a circle or from an ellipse and activating the rectangular grid of **control points**.
		- Even though the grid **appears** circular, the grid remains rectangular - with the **trimmed** area **hidden**. 
			- Therefore, the **domain** is **always** **rectangular**.

## Trimmed/Untrimmed Surfaces
Two different states of surface geometry.
![[Pasted image 20240323103132.png|600]]
#### Untrimmed Surface: 
A surface that **does** **contain** its **full domain**.
	- Untrimmed surfaces **extend** across the **full domain** of its defining parameter space.
		- Typically represented as a *rectangle* in *uv* space (i.e. the 2D parametric space)
			- I.e. Often four sided surfaces, that can take the form of planes, cylinders, cones, spheres, etc. in their entirety. 
	- Are *mathematically pure*:
		- The untrimmed surface's edges align exactly with the [[Surfaces#Isocurves/Isoparametric Curves|isoparametric curves]] that define the surface's bounding extents. 
		- Are defined mathematically by **control points** and **not** have **internal boundaries**.
		- Easy to manipulate, control and edit within modeling software. ^df13a3
#### Trimmed Surface: 
A surface that does **not** **contain** its **domain**.
- Are surfaces that have had parts of their domain removed or excluded from the final geometry.
- They can have irregular and complex boundaries that do not [[#^df13a3|conform to isoparametric curves]] that define the surface's bounding extents.
- The underlying *untrimmed surface* of a trimmed surface **still exists** in its full, original form within the software.
	- Even though it is not visible in the rendered or displayed model.
	- These hidden, additional edges can cause complications.
		- The underlying untrimmed surface extends beyond the visible trimmed boundary.
			- Complicating offsets, fillets, or some exports, etc.
		- Additionally:
			- When performing certain analyses, trimmed edges can sometimes display anomalies due to the mismatch between the mathematical definition of the surface and the visible trimmed boundaries. 
Why Trimmed Surfaces Exist:
- Design Flexibility:
	- Enables designers to create complex, freeform, non rectangular shapes.
- Intersections and Boolean Operations:
	- These "cutting" and "combining" operations result in inherently new edges and boundaries that trim the original surface.
- Efficiency:
	- Computationally more efficient to trim a larger surface.
