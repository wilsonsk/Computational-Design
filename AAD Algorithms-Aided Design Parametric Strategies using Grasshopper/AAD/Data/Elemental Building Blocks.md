# Elemental Building Blocks

##### (Numbers constrained by Domains) -> (Range of Points i.e Vertices within the Domain)-> (Lines/Curves i.e. Edges) ->(Planes/Surfaces) -> (Grids subset of Planes/Surfaces) -> (Solids)

## [[Points|Point]] as the Fundamental Building Block of Form
*For in depth mathematical context, see [[Points#Mathematical Context|mathematical context]]*.

A point is a single entity, or a set with only one element.

A line/curve is a set of $n$ points. 
	I.e. The series of points bound within a domain.
	I.e. The transformation of a point.

A plane/surface is a set of a set of lines/curves each being a set of points.
	I.e. The series of lines/curves bound within a domain.
	I.e. The transformation of a line/curve.
	
A grid is a subset of the set of lines/curves of the plane/surface (i.e. plane/surface set").
	"Vertices, and Edges define the initial curve or grid, which in conjunction with either a directrix or an end curve (i.e. a transformation), are used to generate a surface

A solid or closed surface is a set of a set of planes/surfaces, each being a set of a set of lines/curves, each being a set of points.
	I.e. The series of planes/surfaces bound within a domain.
	I.e. The transformation of a plane/surface.
## [[Transformations#Measures the change between two Points points *P(x,y)* and *P'(x',y')*|Transformations]] of Points as the Fundamental Operation of Generation of Form

A transformation of a single point/vertex.
	Which generates a ordered set of points/vertices.
		 This set of points defines (i.e. determine the bounds of) a line/curve.
			 I.e. Line/curve generation.

A transformation of a line/curve (i.e. a set of points).
	Which generates a set of lines/curves.
		This set of lines/curves defines (determine the bounds aka edges) of a plane/surface.
			 I.e. Plane/surface generation.
