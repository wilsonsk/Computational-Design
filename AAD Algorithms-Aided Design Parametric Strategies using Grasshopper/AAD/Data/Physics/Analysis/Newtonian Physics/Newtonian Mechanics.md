# Newtonian Mechanics
Also called **Classical Mechanics**.
Developed primarily by Sir Isaac Newton (_Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687).
	His framework is fundamental to understanding the motion of "objects" at "everyday" speeds and sizes, forming the cornerstone of classical physics.

Is a system of physics that describes the motion and dynamics of macroscopic objects based on three foundational laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation.
	 It applies to objects moving at speeds much slower than the speed of light and at scales larger than those of atoms and molecules. 

Operates within a specific [[Analysis#Scale|scale]] often referred to as the **Newtonian scale** or **classical scale**. 

Like all physics relies on:
	[[Analysis#1. Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]] specific to its Newtonian [[#Scale (i.e. Newtonian or Classical Scale)|Scale]]
		Involves the description of the initial state of objects without regard to the causes of motion. 
		It focuses on parameters such as position, velocity, and acceleration. 
		By identifying these parameters, kinematics provides a snapshot of where objects are and how they are moving at a specific moment in time, serving as the starting point for predicting future motion.
	[[Analysis#2. Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]] specific to its Newtonian [[#Scale (i.e. Newtonian or Classical Scale)|Scale]]
		Explores the forces that cause or affect the motion of objects, thus explaining the causality of state changes from the initial conditions. 
		Dynamics uses the principles of Newton‚Äôs laws to relate the motion of objects to the forces acting upon them, allowing the prediction of future states based on how these forces alter an object's motion.
## The Key Components of Newtonian (i.e. Classical) Mechanics
#### Newton‚Äôs Three Laws of Motion:
###### First Law (Law of Inertia): 
An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.
###### Second Law (Law of Acceleration): 
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is often expressed as ùêπ=ùëöùëéF=ma, where ùêπF is the net force applied, ùëöm is the mass, and ùëéa is the acceleration.
###### Third Law (Action and Reaction): 
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the first object.
###### Mathematical Formulation:
The laws are typically formulated as differential equations (Newton's second law, ùêπ=ùëöùëéF=ma), which can be solved given initial conditions to predict future states.
#### Universal Law of Gravitation:
Every [[Analysis#A Points Point|point]] mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. 

The force is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, ùêπ=ùê∫ùëö1ùëö2ùëü2F=Gr2m1‚Äãm2‚Äã‚Äã, where ùê∫G is the gravitational constant, ùëö1m1‚Äã and ùëö2m2‚Äã are the masses, and ùëür is the distance between the centers of the two masses.
#### Deterministic Framework:
Newtonian mechanics provides a deterministic framework where the behavior of a physical system can be predicted precisely from initial conditions and known forces, assuming perfect knowledge of the system and no quantum or relativistic effects.
###### Predictability and Determinism:
Newtonian mechanics provides a deterministic framework where, given initial conditions of a system (positions, velocities, etc.), its future behavior can be precisely predicted using mathematical equations.
#### Analytical Techniques:
The framework uses calculus and vector algebra to solve physical problems, enabling the calculation of quantities such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and various forms of energy in dynamic systems.

## The [[Analysis#The Abstract, Non-Physical Abstract Mathematical Objects Abstract, Non-Physical Environments Environment|Mathematical, Abstract, Non-Physical Environment]] of Newtonian (i.e. Classical) Mechanics 

### Components of the Mathematical Abstract Non-Physical Environment in Newtonian Mechanics
1. **Euclidean Geometry**:
    - This is the traditional framework of geometry based on Euclid's postulates, which includes flat, three-dimensional space with infinite divisibility. It provides the spatial structure for Newtonian physics, where points, lines, planes, and volumes are defined in a straightforward, intuitive manner.
2. **Classical Algebra**:
    - Newtonian mechanics relies on algebraic operations that obey the standard rules of arithmetic and algebra. This includes solving equations, manipulating expressions, and using algebraic formulas to describe relationships between physical quantities.
3. **Calculus**:
    - Developed in part by Newton himself, calculus is fundamental to classical mechanics. It allows the description and analysis of dynamic systems through differential and integral calculus. Calculus provides the tools to deal with continuously changing systems, such as calculating velocities, accelerations, and other rates of change.
4. **Vector Spaces**:
    - Vector algebra and vector calculus are essential in classical mechanics to deal with quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, acceleration, force, and momentum. Vectors are used to describe linear motion, rotational dynamics, and the forces acting in systems.
5. **Analytical Mechanics**:
    - Forms like Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics offer powerful alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics based on principles of energy conservation and variational calculus. These are abstract formulations that extend the basic Newtonian framework to more complex or constrained systems and provide deeper insights into the principles of dynamics.
6. **Physical Laws as Mathematical Equations**:
    - The environment encapsulates physical laws in the form of mathematical equations, such as Newton‚Äôs laws of motion (`F = ma` for the second law) and the universal law of gravitation. These equations govern how physical quantities are related and how they evolve over time.
### Scale (i.e. Newtonian or Classical Scale)
This scale is characterized by conditions under which the assumptions of classical mechanics hold true.
	Enabling the use of Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation to predict the behavior of physical systems accurately. 
	
This scale is tremendously useful in everyday engineering, classical physics experiments, and most macroscopic phenomena. 
	For example, it is adequate for designing vehicles, constructing buildings, analyzing machines, and understanding planetary motion.
##### Objects and Phenomena Within this Scale
###### Exist within a Size Range:
The objects are large enough to be observable by the naked eye or with minimal magnification. They are significantly larger than atomic and subatomic scales, typically ranging from a few millimeters to astronomical objects like planets and stars observable without entering the realm of relativistic effects.
###### Move at Sub-Relativistic Speeds:
The velocities involved are much slower than the speed of light (approximately less than one-tenth of the speed of light). At speeds approaching the speed of light, relativistic mechanics would need to be applied instead.
###### Experience Moderate Forces and Energies:
The forces involved do not reach the extremes where quantum effects become non-negligible. Newtonian mechanics is ideal for dealing with everyday physical problems ‚Äî from the motion of balls in sports to the orbital dynamics of planets ‚Äî where gravitational and other classical forces are dominant.
###### Function in a Three-Dimensional Space Over Time:
Classical mechanics typically assumes a Euclidean space, where space is three-dimensional and homogeneous, and time is a separate, independent dimension that progresses at a constant rate for all observers.
###### Observe Non-Quantum Behavior: 
The physical phenomena can be described without needing to consider quantum mechanics. The actions and interactions of macroscopic objects do not exhibit observable quantum effects like superposition or entanglement under normal conditions.
