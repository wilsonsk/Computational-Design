# Analysis
## The Study of how to Learn and Make Predictions based on Physics Related Parameters (i.e. make predictions)

## All Physics is a Consideration of Two Aspects
Each aspect has an associated "way" of describing itself. 
1. [[#Present|Present]]/Initial state.
	- [[#1. Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]].
2. [[#Future|Future]]/changed state.
	- [[#2. Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]]. 

As a means to **predict the future** from the present.

What does that mean? What does "future" mean? What does "present" mean?
### Present
A **state** (static set) of **initial** **conditions** or **parameters** (before a change in any of their values).
#### 1. Kinematics: Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State (of condition, [[Parameters|parameters]]).
It is a complete **description** of an initial **state**. 
	A **list** of only the most **pertinent**, relevant and causal **initial conditions**.

A list of the most **fundamental information** about the **system** at the **initial time**, needed to be able to predict a future outcome within that system.

Identify only the most meaningful information - that is - limit the amount of information to only the necessary.

**Does not consider causality**.

##### Kinematics Have Different Contexts at Different Scales

### Future
The **state** of those **initial** **conditions**/**parameters** **"after"** an **interval** (i.e. change) in variable **time**, $t$.
- The values of such conditions/parameters have to potential to change (i.e. have different values) or remain the same, with a given change/interval in time.
#### 2. Dynamics: "Explains" the Causality of a State Change
**Describes** the **state change**.
And also seeks to **explain the causality** related to **forces** and **torques**.
##### Dynamics Have Different Contexts (and Predictive/Deterministic Capabilities) at Different Scales

###### Macro Scale (i.e. Classical Dynamics/[[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian Mechanics]])
Classical dynamics often provides deterministic results.
	Where initial conditions clearly, objectively cause (i.e. determine) future states.
###### Dynamics at the Macro scale is fundamentally based on **Newton’s three laws of motion**:
###### 1. First Law (Law of Inertia): 
An object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
###### 2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration):
The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object.
###### 3. Third Law (Action and Reaction): 
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
###### Equations of Motion:
Dynamics uses the **equations of motion** that **integrate the effects of forces** to **predict how an object’s velocity and position will change over time**. 

These equations are essential for solving problems involving the motion of objects subject to various macro **forces**.
###### Classical (i.e. macro) Forces:
Classical force as a push or pull concept.
###### Classical (i.e. macro) Energy Methods:
Dynamics also involves the study of energy in systems, focusing on kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy stored due to an object's position). 

The principles of work and energy, as well as conservation of energy, are crucial for analyzing systems dynamically.

###### Micro Scale (i.e. Quantum Dynamics/Quantum Mechanics)
###### Probabilistic over Deterministic
Fundamentally [[Probable Reality|probabilistic]], dealing with likelihoods and uncertainties.
	Where initial conditions **do not** clearly, objectively cause (i.e. do not determine) future states.
		I.e. No objective causality at this scale.

Where every future state is a random draw/sampling a noisy signal, where initial conditions influence probability but do not determine a future state.
###### A Model of Interactions over "Forces"
The fundamental interactions are described by quantum field theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where fields rather than forces are the primary focus, and particle interactions are described by exchange particles like photons and gluons.
###### Quantum (i.e. micro) Forces
At the quantum level, forces are understood as interactions mediated by gauge bosons (e.g., photons for electromagnetic force).
## The Objects that Model the Subject Under Study
Are [[Abstract Mathematical Objects|Abstract Mathematical Objects]], and therefore, exist within an abstract, non-physical environment.
### The Abstract, Non-Physical Environment
It employed because it facilitates clear, objectively causal relationships between these abstract objects.
Thereby, enabling these Abstract Mathematical Objects.
#### Reduction of Complexity: 
A non-physical abstract environment reduces complexity by isolating mathematical concepts from physical attributes. This allows mathematicians to focus on logical relationships without interference from external factors like measurement errors or material properties​​.
#### Facilitation of Clear, Objective Causality: 
Abstract environments provide a setting where relationships between mathematical objects are governed by pure logic, enabling clear, objective causality between them. This clarity helps mathematicians to deduce properties and explore mathematical truths through proofs and axioms​​.
#### Elimination of Ambiguity (i.e. clear, agreed upon, unambiguous definitions): 
In abstract mathematics, concepts are defined rigorously through axioms and definitions, avoiding the ambiguity that can occur in the physical world​​. This allows mathematicians to draw clear conclusions and develop theories with internal consistency.
### A [[Points|Point]]
The point is the fundamental abstract object.
	It has no size or orientation.
		I.e. A point has no **spatial extent**, that is, size (extending into space) associated with a physical object.
		- An object with orientation is called a [[Rigid Body|rigid body]].

#### The Simplest Scenario
A point in one dimension (1D) (i.e. along the $x-axis$) is the simplest scenario.
	The dimensions can't be reduced further, and the object is the most fundamental. 

## The Strategy of Analysis
### From one or two fundamental laws/principles, learn to deduce everything - so not dependent on memorizing equations. 

Therefore, follow the logic and reasoning to make it derivable.
