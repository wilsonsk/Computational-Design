# Analysis
## The Study of how to Learn and Make Predictions based on Physics Related Parameters (i.e. make predictions)

## All Physics is a Consideration of Two Aspects
Each aspect has an associated "way" of describing itself. 
1. [[#Present|Present]]/Initial state.
	- [[#1. Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]].
2. [[#Future|Future]]/changed state.
	- [[#2. Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]]. 

As a means to **predict the future** from the present.
	I.e. Physics utilizes the measurement of changes in the current state of a system to accurately predict future state changes.

What does that mean? 
	Specifically, what does
		"State" mean?
		"Change" mean?
		"Measurement" mean?
		"Present" mean?  
		"Future" mean? ^ccec21
### Scale
Scale refers to the relative size, extent, or magnitude of physical quantities or phenomena as measured or observed in different contexts or frameworks. 

It is a conceptual tool that allows physicists to categorize and compare different physical systems based on their sizes, energies, times, or any other dimensional attributes. 

Each of These [[#^ccec21|Terms]] Has a Different Meaning Depending on the Context of 

**Micro Scale = Quantum Scale**
**Macro Scale = [[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian]] [[Newtonian Mechanics#Scale|Scale]]**
### State
Refers to a comprehensive description of the condition of a system at a given moment.
	This description includes all the necessary information to determine the system's past or future behavior under specific conditions. 

Is a set of **values** or **properties** or **[[Parameters|parameters]]** that encapsulates all the relevant physical attributes necessary to describe the system fully at any specific point in time. 
	These attributes can vary depending on the nature of the system and the scale at which it is being observed.
#### Configuration: 
The arrangement or structure of the system's components, such as the geometric or spatial arrangement of particles in a solid or the phase space configuration in statistical mechanics.
#### Physical Properties:
Such as position (i.e. relative distance), momentum, energy, velocity, and other observable quantities that define the physical characteristics of the system.
#### Quantum Properties:
For quantum systems, the state includes the wavefunction or quantum fields that describe the probabilities of finding the system in various configurations of position, momentum, spin, and other quantum numbers.
#### Thermodynamic Properties:
For systems analyzed under thermodynamics, the state might include temperature, pressure, volume, and internal energy, which describe the system's macroscopic properties.
### Change
#### Motion as Change
In the broadest sense, change is considered the motion that measure between different states of a system.
	Specifically, a change in **position** over **time**.

It is the expression of non-physical and physical processes and interactions.

This definition holds across the various scales of the systems.
#### Time as a Measure of Change
Is a fundamental dimension in physics that enables us to sequence events, measure the duration of events, and quantify the intervals/rates between them. 

It is a scalar quantity that is continuous and unidirectional, often considered as flowing from past through present to future. 

Time provides the framework within which change occurs‚Äîit acts as the independent variable in most dynamical equations that describe how a system evolves.
#### Change in Classical (i.e. Newtonian) Mechanics
##### Classical Change
In classical physics, motion is typically described as the displacement of an object in a space over time. 

It is quantified by changes in the position of an object relative to a reference frame. The key elements involved in the description of motion include:
###### Velocity:
Change in position over time.
###### Acceleration:
Change in velocity over time. These changes can be measured and predicted precisely using Newtonian mechanics under normal conditions, meaning when relativistic effects (those close to the speed of light) or quantum effects (at the atomic and subatomic levels) are negligible.
#### Change in Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, the notion of motion differs significantly due to the fundamental principles of the theory, which includes the dual wave-particle nature of matter, uncertainty principle, and superposition. 

Here, motion does not necessarily refer to a particle moving along a well-defined path.
	Instead, it involves changes in the quantum state of a system, which can be described by:
###### Wavefunction Evolution:
The change of the wavefunction over time, according to the Schr√∂dinger equation, dictates the behavior of quantum systems. This evolution governs how the probabilities of finding particles in various positions or states change.
###### Probability Currents: 
Rather than describing motion as a path from point A to point B, quantum mechanics often talks about the flow of probability, which can be analogous to motion.
### Measurement
Refers to the process of quantitatively determining the properties or state of an object or phenomenon.

The property or characteristic being measured, such as length, time, mass, temperature, velocity, or energy. 
	Each quantity is defined according to standard definitions and units that provide consistency across measurements.

It involves the collection of data through observation and interaction with the system using instruments and methodologies that provide quantifiable results. 
### Present
A **state** (static set) of **initial** **conditions** or **parameters** (before a change in any of their values).
#### 1. Kinematics: Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) [[#State|State]] (of condition, [[Parameters|parameters]]).
It is a complete **description** of an initial **state**. 
	A **list** of only the most **pertinent**, relevant and causal **initial conditions**.

A list of the most **fundamental information** about the **system** at the **initial time**, needed to be able to predict a future outcome within that system.

Identify only the most meaningful information - that is - limit the amount of information to only the necessary.

**Does not consider causality**.
##### Kinematics Have Different Contexts at Different [[#Scale|Scales]]

###### Newtonian (i.e. Classical) Scale
In classical kinematics, motion is described using straightforward and intuitive parameters that stem from everyday observations:

**Position**:
The location of an object in space, typically defined in terms of coordinates in a reference frame (e.g., Cartesian coordinates ùë•,ùë¶,ùëßx,y,z).
###### Velocity:
The rate of change of position with respect to time, indicating both the speed and direction of motion. It is a vector quantity, often represented as ùë£‚Éóv.
###### Acceleration:
The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. This also is a vector quantity, represented as ùëé‚Éóa, and it describes how the velocity of an object is changing at any given point.
###### Time: 
A continuous variable that represents the progression of events from the past through the present into the future.
###### Trajectories:
The paths that objects follow through space as a function of time. These can often be represented by mathematical equations or functions.
###### Quantum Scale
At the quantum scale, particles do not adhere to classical intuitive paths or trajectories. 
	Instead, their behavior is described by a set of different parameters that reflect the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics:	
###### Wavefunction (ùúìœà): 
The fundamental descriptor of a quantum state, representing the amplitude of the probability density function of finding particles like electrons in a particular space and time. The square of the absolute value of the wavefunction, ‚à£ùúì‚à£2‚à£œà‚à£2, gives the probability density of the particle‚Äôs position.
###### Probability Density:
Used instead of definite positions, it provides the likelihood of finding a particle within a particular region of space at a given time.
###### Operators:
Mathematical operations that are applied to wavefunctions to obtain observable quantities (like position, momentum). These are integral in defining measurements in quantum mechanics.    
###### Commutation Relations:
These define how certain pairs of observables, such as position and momentum, interact and impose fundamental limits on their simultaneous measurability (illustrated by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle).
###### Quantum Numbers: 
Sets of discrete values that describe properties like the energy levels of electrons in atoms, angular momentum, spin, etc. These numbers are derived from the solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for quantum systems.
###### Entanglement and Superposition:
Conditions that describe relationships between particles where they share correlated quantum states
### Future
The **state** of those **initial** **conditions**/**parameters** **"after"** an **interval** (i.e. change) in variable **time**, $t$.
- The values of such conditions/parameters have to potential to change (i.e. have different values) or remain the same, with a given change/interval in time.
#### 2. Dynamics: "Explains" the Causality of a State Change
**Describes** the **state change**.
And also seeks to **explain the causality** related to **forces** and **torques**.
##### Dynamics Have Different Contexts (and Predictive/Deterministic Capabilities) at Different Scales

###### Macro Scale (i.e. Classical Dynamics/[[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian Mechanics]])
Classical dynamics often provides deterministic results.
	Where initial conditions clearly, objectively cause (i.e. determine) future states.
###### Dynamics at the Macro scale is fundamentally based on **Newton‚Äôs three laws of motion**:
###### 1. First Law (Law of Inertia): 
An object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
###### 2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration):
The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object.
###### 3. Third Law (Action and Reaction): 
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
###### Equations of Motion:
Dynamics uses the **equations of motion** that **integrate the effects of forces** to **predict how an object‚Äôs velocity and position will change over time**. 

These equations are essential for solving problems involving the motion of objects subject to various macro **forces**.
###### Classical (i.e. macro) Forces:
Classical force as a push or pull concept.
###### Classical (i.e. macro) Energy Methods:
Dynamics also involves the study of energy in systems, focusing on kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy stored due to an object's position). 

The principles of work and energy, as well as conservation of energy, are crucial for analyzing systems dynamically.
###### Micro Scale (i.e. Quantum Dynamics/Quantum Mechanics)
###### Probabilistic over Deterministic
Fundamentally [[Probable Reality|probabilistic]], dealing with likelihoods and uncertainties.
	Where initial conditions **do not** clearly, objectively cause (i.e. do not determine) future states.
		I.e. No objective causality at this scale.

Where every future state exists within a probability distribution, and thus, is a random draw/sampling a noisy signal, where initial conditions influence probability but do not determine a future state.
###### A Model of Interactions over "Forces"
The fundamental interactions are described by quantum field theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where fields rather than forces are the primary focus, and particle interactions are described by exchange particles like photons and gluons.
###### Quantum (i.e. micro) Forces
At the quantum level, forces are understood as interactions mediated by gauge bosons (e.g., photons for electromagnetic force).
### The Abstract, Non-Physical [[Abstract Mathematical Objects#Abstract, Non-Physical Environments|Environment]]
It employed because it facilitates clear, objectively causal relationships between these abstract objects.
Thereby, enabling these Abstract Mathematical Objects.

Used at all scales, quantum to macro.
#### Reduction of Complexity: 
A non-physical abstract environment reduces complexity by isolating mathematical concepts from physical attributes. This allows mathematicians to focus on logical relationships without interference from external factors like measurement errors or material properties‚Äã‚Äã.
#### Facilitation of Clear, Objective Causality: 
Abstract environments provide a setting where relationships between mathematical objects are governed by pure logic, enabling clear, objective causality between them. This clarity helps mathematicians to deduce properties and explore mathematical truths through proofs and axioms‚Äã‚Äã.
#### Elimination of Ambiguity (i.e. clear, agreed upon, unambiguous definitions): 
In abstract mathematics, concepts are defined rigorously through axioms and definitions, avoiding the ambiguity that can occur in the physical world‚Äã‚Äã. This allows mathematicians to draw clear conclusions and develop theories with internal consistency.
### The Objects that Model the Subject Under Study
Are [[Abstract Mathematical Objects|Abstract Mathematical Objects]], and therefore, exist within an abstract, non-physical environment.

Used at all scales.
#### A [[Points|Point]]
The point is the fundamental abstract object.
##### Primary Properties of a Point
The fundamental property of a point is its **position**.
	It is defined by its **coordinates** within a given **space**.
###### Position
A measurable, numerical description of a point's location in space.
	Typically defined **relative** to a reference point or within a coordinate system.
It specifies the existence of something in relation to other objects or things in space.
It is a fundamental descriptor.

The function of a point can be:
	To reference a location.
	To define connectedness of spaces.
		A space is connected if any two points in the space can be joined by a path, entirely contained within the space. 
	To define a set of points (as a line).
	To define geometrical features such as a vertex.
##### A Point Has No Spatial Extent.
A point has no **orientation** because it **lacks physical features** and **dimensions**.
	Points are defined as **Zero-Dimensional**:
		Points contain no - that is - occupies no length, area or volume. 
			I.e. A point has no **size**, that is, size (extending into space).
				An object with orientation (and thus physical characteristics from which to reference orientation) is called a [[Rigid Body|rigid body]].
#### The Simplest Scenario
A point in one dimension (1D) (i.e. along the $x-axis$) is the simplest scenario.
	The dimensions can't be reduced further, and the object is the most fundamental. 
## The Strategy of Analysis
### From one or two fundamental laws/principles, learn to deduce everything
Protects from becoming dependent on memorizing equations. 
	Therefore, follow the logic and reasoning to make it derivable. 
### Application: Decomposing an Analysis Problem
#### *Example*: A point on the $x-axis$
##### 1. Identify the Object/Model
###### Define the Initial State of this Object
Identify what constitutes the [[#Present|present]] - that is - that [[#State|state]] of the object.
	I.e. Identify what constitutes the most maximal [[#State|information]] about this present state.
		1. Place an **origin** on the $x-axis$.
		2. Place **[[|distance]]** **markers** on the $x-axis$.
			- This enables the measurement of distance.
