# Analysis
## The Study of how to Learn and Make Predictions Based on Physics Related [[Parameters|Parameters]] (i.e. make predictions)
As a means to **predict the future** from the present.
	I.e. Physics utilizes the measurement of changes in the current state of a system to accurately predict future state changes.
## All Physics is a Consideration of Two Aspects
Each aspect has an associated "way" of describing itself. 
1. [[#Present|Present]]/Initial state.
	- [[#1. Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]].
2. [[#Future|Future]]/changed state.
	- [[#2. Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]]. 
## Defining the Context
What does:
###### "[[#Scale|Scale]]" mean?
The Scale defines the possible measurable properties that define a state.
###### "[[#State|State]]" mean?
The State defines the initial properties from which change can be defined. 
###### "[[#Change|Change]]" mean?
The Change defines the "present" and "future" states. 
###### "[[#Measurement|Measurement]]" mean?
###### "[[#1. Present|Present]]" mean?  
###### "[[#2. Future|Future]]" mean?

### The Abstract, Non-Physical [[Abstract Mathematical Objects#Abstract, Non-Physical Environments|Environment]]
**Fundamentally** a **scale** is **defined** by the **Mathematical, Abstract, Non-Physical Environment** that **defines** and **constrains** the Mathematical Abstract Non-Physical **Objects** and their behaviors and interactions that are **analyzed** at that scale.
	It employed because it facilitates clear, objectively causal relationships between these abstract objects.
		Thereby, defining and enabling these Abstract Mathematical Objects and their behaviors (possible [[#State|states]], properties, conditions, parameters) and the interactions (i.e. rules of interactions and relations) defined between them (called "additional structure).

Defines the scales, quantum to macro of the object and their interactions and behaviors.
#### Reduction of Complexity: 
A non-physical abstract environment reduces complexity by isolating mathematical concepts from physical attributes. This allows mathematicians to focus on logical relationships without interference from external factors like measurement errors or material properties​​.
#### Facilitation of Clear, Objective Causality: 
Abstract environments provide a setting where relationships between mathematical objects are governed by pure logic, enabling clear, objective causality between them. This clarity helps mathematicians to deduce properties and explore mathematical truths through proofs and axioms​​.
#### Elimination of Ambiguity (i.e. clear, agreed upon, unambiguous definitions): 
In abstract mathematics, concepts are defined rigorously through axioms and definitions, avoiding the ambiguity that can occur in the physical world​​. This allows mathematicians to draw clear conclusions and develop theories with internal consistency.
#### Defining Abstract Environments
##### Nature of Abstract Environments:
###### Structural Frameworks:
**Abstract environments** often **consist** of **sets equipped with additional structure**, which defines operations, relations, or other **properties** that **define** **how** **elements** of the **set** **interact** and **relate** to **each** **other**.
###### Additional Structure
Refers to the rules of interactions and relations between the Abstract Mathematical Objects of a given Abstract Environment.
###### Operational Rules:
They include rules for how operations are performed, which can involve algebraic operations, transformations, or mappings between elements of the set or between different sets.
###### Examples of Abstract Environments:
- **Vector Spaces**: An environment where vectors exist and operations such as vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined.
- **Fields**: Abstract systems in which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are defined, except division by zero.
- **Topological Spaces**: These are sets equipped with a topology, a collection of "open" subsets that satisfy certain properties related to nearness and continuity.
- **Metric Spaces**: Defined by a set with a metric (distance function) that describes the distance between any two points in the set.
- **Hilbert Spaces**: Complete metric spaces with an inner product, facilitating the study of geometric and topological ideas in a more abstract setting.
##### The Framework for Describing and Comparing Abstract Mathematical Environments
###### Category Theory
Category theory provides a high-level framework for describing and comparing Abstract Mathematical Environments as well as mathematical structures through the use of categories.
	And by **abstracting the essence of mathematical objects and focusing on how they interact.**
		This makes it a cornerstone of modern mathematical theory, enabling a deeper understanding of structures and their interrelations across various branches of mathematics and beyond.

A category is defined by a **set of objects** and **morphisms** (arrows) between those objects that satisfy certain compositional properties. 
	**Morphisms as Primary Focus**: In category theory, the primary focus is on the relationships (morphisms) between objects. This perspective is particularly useful for comparing how different structures behave and interact, rather than just comparing the structures (objects) themselves.
	**Functors and Natural Transformations**: These tools in category theory allow for the mapping of objects and morphisms in one category to objects and morphisms in another, preserving their structural relationships. Functors can compare and relate different abstract environments, while natural transformations provide a way to compare functors.
	**Versatility in Application**: Category theory is not restricted to any specific type of mathematical structure. It can describe sets, spaces, groups, rings, vector spaces, and more, as long as these can be conceptualized as objects with morphisms between them. This versatility makes it a powerful tool for describing a wide range of abstract environments.

The abstract environment in category theory is the entire category itself, which abstractly encapsulates the objects and their interactions.
### The Abstract Mathematical Objects that Model the Subject Under Study
Are [[Abstract Mathematical Objects|Abstract Mathematical Objects]], and therefore, exist within an abstract, non-physical environment.
#### Abstract Mathematical Objects are Defined by Properties and Relations
These objects are often characterized more by the relationships they have with other objects and the properties they possess rather than any physical attributes.

They are conceptual entities defined within the framework of mathematical logic and theory, independent of any physical realization.
	These objects are used to model, represent, or describe properties, quantities, or relationships in both pure mathematics and applied sciences.
	
Abstract Mathematical Objects are theoretical constructs that exist in the realm of ideas and mathematical theories. 
	They are not tangible but can be defined by sets of rules or properties in a mathematical system. 
	These objects serve as the fundamental entities with which mathematicians and scientists work to formulate theories, prove theorems, and model various types of physical and abstract systems.
	Their abstract nature means they can be universally applied across different areas of study, making them indispensable tools in the scientific exploration of the universe.

Abstract Mathematical Objects are used at all scales.
	But the objects vary at a given. 
### Scale
Scale refers to the relative size, extent, or magnitude of physical quantities or phenomena as measured or observed in different contexts or frameworks (i.e. Newtonian or Quantum scales, etc.). 
	The Scale determines the measurable [[#State|state]] of the objects defined within it. 

A **mathematical scale** is **defined** by or **within** its [[#The Abstract, Non-Physical Abstract Mathematical Objects Abstract, Non-Physical Environments Environment|abstract mathematical environment]]. 
	Scale is a **conceptual tool** that allows physicists to categorize and compare different physical systems based on their sizes, energies, times, or any other dimensional attributes. 

Each of These [[#Defining the Context|Terms]] Has a Different Meaning Depending on the Context of 

**Micro Scale = [[Quantum Mechanics|Quantum]] [[Quantum Mechanics|Scale]]**
**Macro Scale = [[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian]] [[Newtonian Mechanics#Scale|Scale]]**
### State
Refers to a comprehensive description of the condition of a system at a given moment.
	This description includes all the necessary information to determine the system's past or future behavior under specific conditions. 

Is a set of **values** or **properties** or **[[Parameters|parameters]]** that encapsulates all the relevant physical attributes necessary to describe the system fully at any specific point in time. 
	These attributes can vary depending on the nature of the system and the scale at which it is being observed.
### Change
#### Motion as Change
In the broadest sense, change is considered the motion that measure between different states of a system.
	Specifically, a change in **position** over **time**.

It is the expression of non-physical and physical processes and interactions.

This definition holds across the various scales of the systems.
#### Time as a Measure of Change
Is a fundamental dimension in physics that enables us to sequence events, measure the duration of events, and quantify the intervals/rates between them. 

It is a scalar quantity that is continuous and unidirectional, often considered as flowing from past through present to future. 

Time provides the framework within which change occurs—it acts as the independent variable in most dynamical equations that describe how a system evolves.
### Measurement
Refers to the process of quantitatively determining the properties or state of an object or phenomenon.

The property or characteristic being measured, such as length, time, mass, temperature, velocity, or energy. 
	Each quantity is defined according to standard definitions and units that provide consistency across measurements.

It involves the collection of data through observation and interaction with the system using instruments and methodologies that provide quantifiable results. 
### 1. Present
A **state** (static set) of **initial** **conditions** or **parameters** (before a change in any of their values).
#### Kinematics: Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) [[#State|State]] (of condition, [[Parameters|parameters]]).
It is a complete **description** of an initial **state**. 
	A **list** of only the most **pertinent**, relevant and causal **initial conditions**.

A list of the most **fundamental information** about the **system** at the **initial time**, needed to be able to predict a future outcome within that system.

Identify only the most meaningful information - that is - limit the amount of information to only the necessary.

**Does not consider causality**.
##### Kinematics are Different in [[Newtonian Mechanics#Analysis Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ). Kinematics|Newtonian/Classical Kinematics]] and [[Quantum Mechanics#Analysis Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ). Kinematics|Quantum Kinematics]]

### 2. Future
The **state** of those **initial** **conditions**/**parameters** **"after"** an **interval** (i.e. change) in variable **time**, $t$.
- The values of such conditions/parameters have to potential to change (i.e. have different values) or remain the same, with a given change/interval in time.
#### Dynamics: "Explains" the Causality of a State Change
**Describes** the **state change**.
And also seeks to **explain the causality** related to **forces** and **torques**.
##### Dynamics are Different in  [[Newtonian Mechanics#Analysis 1. Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ). Kinematics|Newtonian/Classical Kinematics]] and [[Quantum Mechanics#Analysis Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change Dynamics|Quantum Dynamics]]

## The Strategy of Analysis
### From one or two fundamental laws/principles, learn to deduce everything
Protects from becoming dependent on memorizing equations. 
	Therefore, follow the logic and reasoning to make it derivable. 
### Application: Decomposing an Analysis Problem
#### *Example*: A point on the $x-axis$
##### 1. Identify the Object/Model
###### Define the Initial State of this Object
Identify what constitutes the [[#Present|present]] - that is - that [[#State|state]] of the object.
	I.e. Identify what constitutes the most maximal [[#State|information]] about this present state.
		1. Place an **origin** on the $x-axis$.
		2. Place **[[|distance]]** **markers** on the $x-axis$.
			- This enables the measurement of distance.
