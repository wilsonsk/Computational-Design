# Linear Combinations
A linear combination involves creating a new vector (or value) by multiplying a set of vectors (or numbers) by scalars and then summing the results. Formally, if you have vectors v1,v2,…,vn\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}, \ldots, \mathbf{v_n}v1​,v2​,…,vn​ and scalars a1,a2,…,ana_1, a_2, \ldots, a_na1​,a2​,…,an​, the linear combination is:
## The Fundamental Property (i.e. Linearity)
**Linearity**:
A linear proportion is a relationship between two variables where one variable is a constant multiple of the other. 

This property is preserved in linear combinations, which means that the sum of scaled vectors (or variables) will also maintain linear relationships.

**Constant Multiples**: 
Linear proportion shows that scaling one variable by a constant results in a directly proportional change in the other variable. In a linear combination, each term is scaled by a constant (scalar multiplier), preserving the linear relationship.
	**Example**: If you have two vectors v1\mathbf{v_1}v1​ and v2\mathbf{v_2}v2​, their linear combination a1v1+a2v2a_1\mathbf{v_1} + a_2\mathbf{v_2}a1​v1​+a2​v2​ is scalable. If v1\mathbf{v_1}v1​ and v2\mathbf{v_2}v2​ are scaled by constants, their combination remains linear.

**Additivity**:
- **Sum of Proportions**: In linear combinations, adding together multiple terms (each term being a scaled vector or variable) still results in a linear relationship. This is akin to combining multiple linear proportions.
- **Example**: If y1=k1xy_1 = k_1xy1​=k1​x and y2=k2xy_2 = k_2xy2​=k2​x, then the sum y=y1+y2=k1x+k2x=(k1+k2)xy = y_1 + y_2 = k_1x + k_2x = (k_1 + k_2)xy=y1​+y2​=k1​x+k2​x=(k1​+k2​)x also maintains a linear relationship with xxx.

## Linear Proportion as a Simple Linear Combination:

- A linear proportion can be viewed as a specific, simple case of a linear combination.
- Consider the linear proportion y=kxy = kxy=kx. This can be thought of as a linear combination where you have a single vector (or number) xxx and a single scalar kkk. Here, yyy is the result of the linear combination kxkxkx.

## Extension to Multiple Variables:

- Linear combinations generalize the concept of linear proportion to multiple variables. Instead of relating just two variables as in a linear proportion, a linear combination involves multiple terms.
- For example, in a linear combination like y=a1x1+a2x2+…+anxny = a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_ny=a1​x1​+a2​x2​+…+an​xn​, each xix_ixi​ is weighted by a corresponding scalar aia_iai​, creating a new variable yyy that is the sum of these weighted terms.
- If we think of each xix_ixi​ as representing a different dimension, the linear combination yyy represents a linear proportion in a higher-dimensional space.
