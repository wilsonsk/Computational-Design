### Linear Relationship
A linear relationship between two variables is one in which the **change** in the dependent variable ($y$) is directly proportional to the **change** in the independent variable ($x$), plus a constant.
	This is described by the [[#Constant of Proportionality (i.e. Constant Rate of Change)|Constant of Proportionality]]
#### [[Linearity in the Field of Real Numbers#1. Proportionality of Linearity|Proportionality of Linearity]]
The proportionality property of linearity refers to the characteristic of a linear relationship where the dependent variable **changes** at a constant rate with respect to the independent variable.
	The proportionality property of linearity is fundamentally about a **constant rate of change between two variables.**
##### Constant of Linear Proportionality is a Constant Rate of Change ($\LARGE m$)
The constant $m$ is a scalar called the slope, which represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$, but there is an additional offset $b$.
	This represents the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$.
$$\LARGE \text{For } y = mx + b, \space m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
The constant of proportionality is a fixed value that relates the input and output variables in a directly proportional relationship.
	The dependent variable $y$ changes at a constant rate with respect to the independent variable $x$. 
		This rate is given by the a **specific scalar**, the **slope** $m$. 
			For every unit increase in $x$, $y$ changes by $m$ units.
				The constant of proportionality ($\LARGE m$ in $\LARGE y = mx$) determines the rate at which the output changes with respect to the input.
					$m$ is the constant of proportionality that scales the input $x$ to produce the output $y$.
						The Rate of Change remains constant regardless of the value of the y-intercept $b$.

##### Form of a Linear Function
$$\LARGE y = mx + b, \space m = \frac{ y}{ x}$$
##### Form of a Linear Equation
$$\LARGE c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \dots + c_nx_n = b$$
$$\LARGE \text{Where} \quad x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n \quad = \quad\text{the unknowns} \quad x,y,z, w, \dots$$
$$\LARGE \text{Where} \quad c_1,c_2,\dots, c_n \quad = \quad\text{the coefficients} \quad m \dots$$
$$\LARGE \text{Where} \quad b \quad = \quad\text{a constant} $$
$$\large \text{Where} \quad c_1x_1,c_2x_2,\dots, c_nx_n \quad= \quad\text{a Linear Combination of the unknowns}$$
###### Unknowns
Are variable values that are not fixed. 
###### Constants
Are **fixed scalar values** that are not scaling any other entity.
	I.e. Are "stand alone" scalar values.
###### Coefficients
Are **fixed scalar values** that are scaling some other entity.
	I.e. Are "coupled" scalar values.
## The Definition of a Linear Equation
An equation is Linear if it can be written in the form:
$$\LARGE c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \dots + c_nx_n = b$$
###### For Example
$$\LARGE 2x + 3y - z = 7 - x + 3z$$
$$\LARGE 2x (\textcolor{red}{+ x})+ 3y - z (\textcolor{red}{-3z})= 7 - \cancel{x} (\cancel{\textcolor{red}{+ x}}) + \cancel{3z}(\cancel{\textcolor{red}{-3z}})$$
$$\LARGE 3x +3y - 4z = 7$$
