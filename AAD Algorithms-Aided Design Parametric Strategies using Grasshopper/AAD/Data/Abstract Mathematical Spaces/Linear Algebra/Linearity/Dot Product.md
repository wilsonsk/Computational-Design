# Dot Product
The dot product (also known as the scalar product) of two vectors results in a **scalar**, not a vector. However, the expression of the dot product can still be broken down in vector notation. Here's how it looks:

Given two vectors:
$$
\LARGE \mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, a_3] \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, b_3]
$$

The dot product is defined as:
$$
\LARGE \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3
$$

In terms of vector components, if the vectors are in **3-dimensional space**, the dot product formula looks like:
$$
\LARGE \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i b_i
$$

In a more generalized form for **n-dimensional vectors**:
$$
\LARGE \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i
$$

### Geometric Interpretation
The dot product can also be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between them:
$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \cos \theta
$$
where $|\mathbf{a}|$ and $|\mathbf{b}|$ are the magnitudes (lengths) of vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.
