# Vectors as Linear Functions
In the context of functional analysis and [[Linear Map#Vector Space|vector spaces]], a continuous function can be thought of as a vector. 
	This might seem non-intuitive at first because we usually think of vectors as arrows in space with magnitude and direction. 
		However, the concept of a vector can be generalized to include functions.
### Understanding Functions as Vectors
 A vector space is a set of elements, called vectors, that can be added together and multiplied by scalars, satisfying certain properties.
 
Consider the set of all continuous functions defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$, denoted $C([a,b])$. 
	Each function $f \in C([a, b])$ assigns a real number $f(x)$ to each point $x$ in the interval $[a,b]$.

In this setup:
- **Vectors**: Elements of the vector space are continuous functions.
- **Vector Addition**: The sum of two continuous functions fff and ggg is a new function (f+g)(f + g)(f+g) defined by (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x).
- **Scalar Multiplication**: The product of a scalar ccc and a continuous function fff is a new function (cf)(cf)(cf) defined by (cf)(x)=c⋅f(x)(cf)(x) = c \cdot f(x)(cf)(x)=c⋅f(x).

### Visualizing Functions as Vectors
To visualize this, think of each function as a "point" in an infinite-dimensional space, where each point on the interval [a,b][a, b][a,b] corresponds to a dimension.
	Just like finite-dimensional vectors, you can "add" two functions or "scale" a function by multiplying it with a scalar.
