# Dot Product 
The dot product (also known as the scalar product) of two vectors in Euclidean space has a geometric interpretation that connects it to the projection concept.
###### Components
**Dot Product $a \cdot b$** gives us a measure of how much one vector extends in the direction of another.
$$\LARGE a \cdot b$$
This measures how much $a$ goes in the direction of $b$. 
	If $a$ and $b$ are pointing in the same direction, the dot product is large and positive.
		 If they are perpendicular, the dot product is zero. 
			 If they are in opposite directions, the dot product is negative.
 
The dot product of two vectors $a$ and $b$ is defined as:

$$a \cdot b = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n b_n$$

This gives a scalar (a single number) that represents how much of $a$ is in the direction of $b$.
##### Self-Dot Product $b \cdot b$:
The dot product of $b$ with itself is:

$$b \cdot b = b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \ldots + b_n^2$$
This is the same as the square of the magnitude (length) of $b$.
##### Magnitude $\|b\|$:
The magnitude (or norm) of vector $b$ is denoted as $\|b\|$ and is defined as:

$$\|b\| = \sqrt{b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \ldots + b_n^2}$$
It represents the length of the vector $b$.
## Geometric Interpretation
Consider two vectors $a$ and $b$ in a Euclidean space. 
	Let $\theta$ be the angle between them. 
		The geometric definition of the dot product involves the magnitudes (lengths) of these vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.

### Steps to Derive the Dot Product
1. **Definition of the Dot Product** The dot product of two vectors $a$ and $b$, written as $a \cdot b$, is defined as:$$a \cdot b = \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$where:

- $|a|$ is the magnitude of $a$,
- $|b|$ is the magnitude of $b$,
- $\theta$ is the angle between $a$ and $b$.

2. **[[Projection#Scalar Projection|Scalar Projection]]** The projection of $a$ onto $b$ (or vice versa) helps to understand the dot product. 
	1. The projection of $a$ onto the direction of $b$ is given by the component of $a$ that lies along $b$. This projection is:$$\LARGE \| a \| \cos \theta = \frac{a \cdot b}{\|b\|}$$$$\LARGE \text{proj}_{b} a = \|a\| \cos \theta$$

4. **Using Projections** If we project $a$ onto $b$, the length of this projection is $|a| \cos \theta$. This projection is then scaled by the magnitude of $b$ to give the dot product:$$a \cdot b = \|b\| \times (\|a\| \cos \theta)$$
5. Thus:$$a \cdot b = \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
### Algebraic Interpretation
Now let's derive the dot product from an algebraic perspective, starting from the components of the vectors.

1. **Component Form of Vectors** Let vectors $a$ and $b$ be represented in component form as:$$a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$
$$b = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)$$
2. **Definition of Dot Product in Component Form** The dot product of $a$ and $b$ in $n$-dimensional space is defined as:$$a \cdot b = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n b_n$$
3. **Connection to Geometry** To connect this component form to the geometric definition, we use the Law of Cosines. For vectors $a$ and $b$, the Law of Cosines in a plane spanned by these vectors states:$$\|a - b\|^2 = \|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 - 2 \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
4. **Expressing the Distance Squared** The squared distance between $a$ and $b$ in terms of components is:$$\|a - b\|^2 = (a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 + \ldots + (a_n - b_n)^2$$
5. Expanding this:$$\|a - b\|^2 = a_1^2 + b_1^2 - 2 a_1 b_1 + a_2^2 + b_2^2 - 2 a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n^2 + b_n^2 - 2 a_n b_n$$
6. This can be grouped as:$$\|a - b\|^2 = \|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 - 2 (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n b_n)$$
7. **Equating Both Expressions** From the geometric interpretation, we know:$$\|a - b\|^2 = \|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 - 2 \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
8. Equating the two expressions for $|a - b|^2$:$$\|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 - 2 (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n b_n) = \|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 - 2 \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
9. Canceling $|a|^2 + |b|^2$ from both sides:$$-2 (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n b_n) = -2 \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
10. Dividing both sides by $-2$:$$a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \ldots + a_n b_n = \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
11. Thus, we have derived the dot product equation from both geometric and algebraic perspectives:$$a \cdot b = \|a\| \|b\| \cos \theta$$
This shows how the dot product encapsulates the geometric idea of projection and angle between two vectors.
