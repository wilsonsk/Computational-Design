# Vector [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Structured Set (i.e. Space)|Space]]
A vector space is a [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Structured Set (i.e. Space)|structured set]] consisting of a collection of vectors, which can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars.
##### Scalar
Scalars are typically elements of a field, such as the real numbers (R\mathbb{R}R) or complex numbers (C\mathbb{C}C). Vector spaces are fundamental in linear algebra and are used extensively in many areas of mathematics and science.
### Elements, Objects, and Structure of a Vector Space

#### Elements of a Vector Space

- **Vectors**: The basic elements of a vector space are called vectors. Vectors can be thought of as points in a coordinate system, arrows in space, or more abstractly, as elements satisfying the axioms of a vector space.

#### Structure of a Vector Space

- **Field of Scalars (\(F\))**: The set of scalars over which the vector space is defined. This is typically a field like \(\mathbb{R}\) (real numbers) or \(\mathbb{C}\) (complex numbers).
- **Vector Addition**: An operation that takes two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) and produces another vector \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\) in the same vector space.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: An operation that takes a scalar \(a\) and a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) and produces another vector \(a \mathbf{v}\) in the same vector space.

#### Axioms of a Vector Space

A set \(V\) with operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication is called a vector space over a field \(F\) if it satisfies the following axioms for all \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V\) and all scalars \(a, b \in F\):

1. **Associativity of Addition**: \(\mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w}\)
2. **Commutativity of Addition**: \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\)
3. **Identity Element of Addition**: There exists an element \(\mathbf{0} \in V\) such that \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{u}\) for all \(\mathbf{u} \in V\)
4. **Inverse Elements of Addition**: For each \(\mathbf{u} \in V\), there exists an element \(-\mathbf{u} \in V\) such that \(\mathbf{u} + (-\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{0}\)
5. **Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication**: \(a(b \mathbf{v}) = (ab) \mathbf{v}\)
6. **Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication**: \(1 \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}\) for all \(\mathbf{v} \in V\) where \(1\) is the multiplicative identity in \(F\)
7. **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with Respect to Vector Addition**: \(a (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a \mathbf{u} + a \mathbf{v}\)
8. **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with Respect to Field Addition**: \((a + b) \mathbf{v} = a \mathbf{v} + b \mathbf{v}\)

### Summary

- **Vector Space**: A set of vectors equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication, satisfying the vector space axioms.
- **Elements (Vectors)**: The basic objects in the vector space.
- **Field of Scalars (\(F\))**: Provides the scalars used in scalar multiplication.
- **Structure**: Defined by vector addition and scalar multiplication operations, adhering to specific axioms.

## Calculus as the Logical Outcome of the Structure of Vector Space
**Vector Spaces** provide the structural foundation that supports the operations and concepts of calculus. 
	The properties of vector spaces ensure that differentiation, integration, limits, and continuity are well-defined and meaningful.

**Calculus** arises naturally from the structure of vector spaces, leveraging their linear, topological, and sometimes additional geometric properties.
### Calculus as a Framework within the Structure of Vector Space
Calculus itself is not a subset of vector spaces. 
	Instead, it is a mathematical framework that leverages the structure of vector spaces to study and analyze functions and their behaviors.
	
Calculus is performed on vector spaces by defining differentiation, integration, and other operations on functions that map between vector spaces.
#### Calculus Framework within Base Structure of Vector Space
###### Framework
Refers to the overarching principles and methods of calculus that can be applied broadly. It guides how we think about and approach mathematical problems involving change and accumulation.
	It is a conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for building something that expands the initial concept.

Calculus as a framework means it provides the rules, operations, and concepts (like differentiation, integration, limits, and continuity) that can be applied **within** various mathematical structures.
	Calculus provides a set of concepts, methods, and principles (such as differentiation, integration, limits, and continuity) that are used to analyze and describe changes and accumulation.

This Calculus framework does not redefine the vector space itself but enhances our ability to study and apply more complex mathematical concepts within the space.
	The framework of calculus can be seen as a toolbox of methods and concepts that can be applied to various mathematical structures, such as vector spaces, metric spaces, and topological spaces.
###### Structure
The arrangement or organization of components that defines how elements in a set interact, often through specific operations and properties (axioms).
	A vector space is the **base structure** because it is defined by the set of vectors along with vector addition and scalar multiplication that follow specific axioms.
#### Calculus as Additional Structure in Vector Spaces
The existence of the calculus framework means that for its operations to be applied meaningfully, they must be defined on specific mathematical structures, such as vector spaces.
	For calculus to be applied within vector spaces, operations like differentiation and integration must be specifically defined on the elements (functions or vectors) of those spaces.
		When these operations are defined within a vector space, they indeed add additional structure to the space.
			Operations as structure are the concrete implementation of the abstract principles provided by the framework of calculus.
				By adding calculus operations to a vector space, we are enriching the space with new ways to manipulate and understand its elements. These operations become an integral part of the space's structure.


When we talk about adding structure to a vector space, we are referring to the imposition of additional operations, properties, or axioms that allow us to explore more advanced concepts, such as those found in calculus. 
	This does not redefine the vector space itself but enhances our ability to study and apply more complex mathematical concepts within the space.

When calculus operations (such as differentiation and integration) are defined on a specific set, they become part of the structure of that set. This means that the set is equipped with additional operations that follow specific rules and properties.
