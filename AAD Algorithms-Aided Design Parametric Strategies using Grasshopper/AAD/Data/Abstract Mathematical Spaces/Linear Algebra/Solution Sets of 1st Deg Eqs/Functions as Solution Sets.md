# Functions as Solution Sets
The linear equations that describe lines in the plane ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^2$), are themselves just sets of mapped variables from a domain to a codomain. 

The linear equations that describe lines in the space ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^3$), are themselves just sets of mapped variables from a domain to a codomain. 

The linear equations that describe planes in the space ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^3$), are themselves just sets of mapped variables from a domain to a codomain. 
## Geometry as Solution Sets
The [[Straight Lines|lines]] in the plane ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^2$) themselves are also just sets of mapped variables from a domain ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^2$) to a codomain. 

The [[Straight Lines|lines]] in the space ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^3$) themselves are also just sets of mapped variables from a domain ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^2$) to a codomain. 

The [[Planes|planes]] in the space ($\LARGE \mathbb{R}^3$), are themselves just sets of mapped variables from a domain to a codomain.
