# Curve Theory
At the most fundamental, a curve is a set from a Domain, that is mapped to a set in a Codomain. 
	I.e. A curve at the most fundamental is a function. 

## Curves as a Graph of a Function

## Curves as the Solution Set of an Equation in Two Variables

This Circle is the Solution Set of this Equation.
## Curves Defined Geometrically (e.g. By Distances)

## Curve as the Path of a Moving Object (e.g. a Particle, object, etc.)
Curves as Vector Valued Functions.
	Previous representations of the curve were only Interested in the path.
		But this representation is also interested in the way in the movement is happening (i.e. the Analysis of the Path).
			It is a richer way of looking at the curve.
## Curve as the [[Transformations|Transformation]] of an [[Domain|Interval]]
A one-dimensional object (i.e. an "endlessly thin object").
	A [[Straight Lines|Line]] *is* a curve.
