# Equations vs. Functions
###### Every Function is an Equation, but not every Equation is a Function.

In mathematics, both functions and equations are essential concepts that describe relationships between variables. 
$$\LARGE f(x) = mx + b \quad \equiv \quad y = mx + b \quad \equiv \quad b = y - mx$$

In a hierarchical sense, you can think of **functions** as a subset or **specific type of equation**, but with additional structure and specific characteristics. Let's explore how this works conceptually:
### Equations (General Concept)
An **equation** is a **statement of equality** between two mathematical expressions. 
	It typically describes a **relationship** between variables or constants.
		 For example:
			$\LARGE x+2=5$ is a simple equation.
			$\LARGE y=2x+3$ is a linear equation describing the relationship between $y$ and $x$.

An equation tells you that two expressions are equal under certain conditions, but it doesn't necessarily specify a **mapping** or dependency between variables. 
	Equations are very general and can include relationships where variables don’t have a one-way dependency (e.g., implicit equations like $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, which describes a circle but doesn’t express $y$ directly in terms of $x$).
###### Equations
Describes the equality between two expressions.
	The output is a constant which therefore, means it does not "depend" on an "input". 
		Instead, the goal is to identify the set of values (of the variables) that "satisfies" the conditions (i.e. the structure relationships of the equality of the two expressions),
			I.e. To find the set of values that makes the equation "true".
				In an equation, a single input can correspond to multiple outputs. 
					 Additionally, the equation might not define a direct relationship between input and output as a function does.

**Equations** give you the **whole set** of possible solutions at once, but they don’t give you the **sequence** or process of obtaining those points.
	Equations are great for defining **shapes** or **curves** (like circles, ellipses, lines, etc.) because they give you the entire **set of solutions** that satisfy the relationship between variables.
### Functions (A Specific Type of Equation)
A **function** is a special kind of equation, where there is a clear and **explicit mapping** from one variable (the **independent variable**) to another (the **dependent variable**). 
	In a function, for every input, there is exactly **one output**. 
		This is a key property that distinguishes functions from general equations.

For example, $\LARGE y=2x+3$ **can be viewed as both an equation and a function**.
	It tells you that for each value of $x$, there is a corresponding value of $y$, and the function is $f(x)=2x+3$.
###### Functions
Describe specific mappings between an independent input variable and the dependent output variable.
	Therefore, each input $\LARGE x$ in the domain maps to one and only one output $\LARGE y=f(x)$. 
		The goal is to 

**Functions** describe relationships **dynamically**

**Functions** allow you to **calculate** specific outcomes based on inputs and give a sense of **flow** (like parametric curves that describe movement over time or space).
### Hierarchy: Equations vs. Functions
**Equations** are the **broader category**. 
	They describe relationships between variables and can take many forms, including implicit equations, where it’s not easy to solve one variable in terms of another.

**Functions** are a **specific subset** of equations where the relationship between variables is more structured: one variable (the dependent variable) is explicitly expressed as a function of another variable (the independent variable).

In other words, every function is an equation, but not every equation is a function. 
	The distinction lies in the **one-to-one mapping** characteristic of functions.
### Implicit Equations vs. Functions
Some equations, like the equation of a circle x2+y2=1x^2 + y^2 = 1x2+y2=1, are **implicit equations**. 
	They describe a relationship between $x$ and $y$, but they don’t easily allow you to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ (or vice versa) in a way that defines a **function**.

To make such an equation a function, you would need to restrict it, for example, to the upper or lower semicircle:
- Upper semicircle: $y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$
- Lower semicircle: $y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}$

Each of these is now a **function** because it defines a **one-to-one relationship** for $y$ in terms of $x$.

## Functions: Direct Mapping of Variables to Outputs

A **function** is a specific type of mathematical relationship where each **input (from a set called the domain) is mapped to exactly one output** (in a set called the **codomain**). 
	This relationship can be described as $\LARGE y=f(x)$, where:
		$\LARGE x$ is the **independent variable** or input.
		$\LARGE y$ is the **dependent variable** or output, determined by the function $\LARGE f$.
### Key Characteristics of Functions

- **One-to-One Mapping**: Each input $\LARGE x$ in the domain maps to one and only one output $\LARGE y=f(x)$. 
	- This rule ensures that a function provides a clear, unambiguous output for every input.

- **Example**: In the function $\LARGE f(x)=x^2$, for every real number $\LARGE x$, the output $\LARGE f(x)$ is the square of $\LARGE x$. Here, $\LARGE x=2$ and $\LARGE x=-2$ both produce the same output $\LARGE f(x)=4$, but each individual input still maps to a single output.

### Variables in Functions

- **Independent Variable (Input)**: The variable $\LARGE x$ can be freely chosen from the domain. It is the "driver" of the function.
- **Dependent Variable (Output)**: The variable $\LARGE y=f(x)$ depends on $\LARGE x$ and is uniquely determined by the function's rule.

### Output and Solution Set

- The **output** of a function is a single value $\LARGE y$ for each input $\LARGE x$.
- The **solution set** for a function like $\LARGE y=f(x)$ typically consists of all pairs $(x,y)$ where $\LARGE y=f(x)$. For instance, the function $\LARGE f(x)=x^2$ produces the set of pairs $(x,x^2)$.

### Functions: Generating an Output from an Input

In a **function**, the focus is on mapping inputs to outputs. Here's the key difference:

- **Structure**: A function is typically written as $\LARGE y = f(x)$, where $\LARGE f$ is a rule or formula that takes an input $\LARGE x$ and produces an output $\LARGE y$.

- **Variables**: The variable $\LARGE x$ is the **independent variable** (or input), and $\LARGE y$ is the **dependent variable** (or output). The function provides a specific, deterministic rule that tells you what $\LARGE y$ is for any given $\LARGE x$.

- **Output**: The output is **directly derived** from the input using the function's rule. For every value of $\LARGE x$, the function $\LARGE f(x)$ produces exactly one value of $\LARGE y$.

- **Example**: In the function $\LARGE f(x) = x^2$, if you input $\LARGE x = 3$, the output is $\LARGE f(x) = 9$. The function computes the output based on the input, according to the rule it defines.

## Equations: Describing Relationships Between Variables

An **equation** is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. Unlike functions, equations can involve multiple variables and describe more general relationships that may not fit the strict one-to-one mapping of functions.

### Key Characteristics of Equations

- **Multiple Outputs Possible**: In an equation, a single input can correspond to multiple outputs. Additionally, the equation might not define a direct relationship between input and output as a function does.

- **Example**: The equation $\LARGE x^2+y^2=1$ describes a circle. For a given $\LARGE x$, there can be two corresponding values of $\LARGE y$ (one positive and one negative), both of which satisfy the equation.

### Equations: Satisfying a Condition

In an **equation**, the goal is to find values for the variables that satisfy a given condition. Here's how it works:

- **Structure**: An equation is typically written as two expressions set equal to each other. For example, in $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$, the left side is $\LARGE x^2 + y^2$, and the right side is $\LARGE 1$.

- **Variables**: The variables (in this case, $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$) are the unknowns that you need to find. The equation defines a **relationship** between these variables, and the **goal** is to find all pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy this relationship.

- **Output**: The output here isn't a single value like in a function. Instead, the output is a **set of solutions**—all the pairs $(x, y)$ that make the equation true. For $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$, this set of solutions is all the points on the circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.

- **Example**: If you set $\LARGE x = 0$ in the equation $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$, the equation becomes $\LARGE y^2 = 1$. The solutions for $\LARGE y$ are $\LARGE y = 1$ and $\LARGE y = -1$. Here, the equation tells you what values of $\LARGE y$ will satisfy the condition when $\LARGE x$ is 0.

### Variables in Equations

- **Interdependent Variables**: In equations, variables are often interdependent. For example, in $\LARGE x^2+y^2=1$, $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$ are related in such a way that changing one affects the other.

- **Free and Dependent Variables**: Some equations may have free variables that can take any value within a certain range, with other variables depending on these choices.

### Output and Solution Set

- The **solution set** of an equation consists of all pairs (or tuples) of values that satisfy the equation. For $\LARGE x^2+y^2=1$, the solution set is the set of all points $(x,y)$ that lie on the circle.

- Unlike functions, the solution set of an equation may not correspond to a single output for a given input. Instead, it can be a set of multiple solutions or points.

### Equations with Constant Outcomes

As previously discussed, many equations have a constant on one side, setting a fixed condition that the variables must satisfy. 

- **Example**: $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$
  - **Outcome**: The constant $\LARGE 1$ defines a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.
  - **Solution Set**: All points $(x, y)$ that lie on this circle.

### Equations with Variable Outcomes

When an equation does **not** have a constant on one side, both sides of the equation involve variables. In such cases, the "outcome" is an **expression involving variables** rather than a fixed constant. This type of equation defines a relationship between variables without restricting it to a single fixed condition.

#### Understanding Variable Outcomes

- **Structure**: An equation might have expressions involving multiple variables on both sides. 

- **Example**: $\LARGE 2x + 3y = 4x - y$. Here, neither side of the equation is a constant; both sides contain variable terms.

- **Interpretation**:
  - The equation establishes a relationship between $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$.
  - It implies that for certain values of $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$, the equality holds true.
  - The equation can be rearranged to express one variable in terms of the other or to identify a line or other geometric object representing all possible solutions.

#### Solution Sets for Variable Outcomes

- **Infinite Solutions**: When an equation has variable outcomes, it often has infinitely many solutions unless further constraints are applied.

- **Example**: $\LARGE 2x+3y=4x−y$
  - Simplifying: $\LARGE 2x+3y−4x+y=0 \implies −2x+4y=0 \implies y=\frac{1}{2}x$. 
  - **Solution Set**: All pairs $(x,y)$ where $\LARGE y=\frac{1}{2}x$. This represents a straight line through the origin with a slope of $\LARGE \frac{1}{2}$.

- **Dependent Relationships**: Such equations often describe **lines**, **planes**, or higher-dimensional surfaces in their respective spaces.
  
- **Example**: $\LARGE x+y+z=0$
  - **Solution Set**: All triples $(x,y,z)$ that lie on the plane defined by this equation in three-dimensional space.

- **Parametric Solutions**: When dealing with multiple variables, solutions can often be expressed using parameters.

- **Example**: $\LARGE 2x+3y=4x−y$
- **Example**: $\LARGE 2x+3y=4x-y$
  - **Solution Set**: $\LARGE y=\frac{1}{2}x$. You can let $\LARGE x=t$ (a parameter), then $\LARGE y=\frac{1}{2}t$. So, solutions can be expressed as $(t,\frac{1}{2}t)$ for any real number $\LARGE t$.

### When Does an Equation Become a Function?

An equation becomes a function when it satisfies the criteria that define a function. Specifically, an equation can be considered a function when it establishes a relationship between two variables such that for each input value (from the domain), there is exactly one output value (in the codomain).

### Key Criteria for an Equation to Become a Function

1. **Uniqueness of Output**:
   - For an equation to be a function, every input value must correspond to exactly one output value.
   - **Example:** Consider the equation $\LARGE y = 2x + 3$. This equation defines a function because for every value of $\LARGE x$ (input), there is exactly one corresponding value of $\LARGE y$ (output).

2. **Dependent and Independent Variables**:
   - An equation typically involves multiple variables. For it to be considered a function, one variable (the output or dependent variable) must be expressed as a function of the other variable (the input or independent variable).
   - **Example:** The equation $\LARGE y = x^2$ is a function because $\LARGE y$ is uniquely determined by the value of $\LARGE x$.

3. **Vertical Line Test (Graphical Representation)**:
   - A graphical test for determining whether an equation represents a function is the **vertical line test**. If any vertical line drawn through the graph of the equation intersects it at no more than one point, the equation represents a function.
   - **Example:** The equation $\LARGE y = x^2$ passes the vertical line test, so it represents a function. In contrast, the equation $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$ (a circle) does not pass the vertical line test, so it is not a function (because for some values of $\LARGE x$, there are two corresponding values of $\LARGE y$).

### When an Equation is Also a Function

The equation $\LARGE y = mx + b$ is both an equation **and** a function. Here’s why:

- **Equation:** In the broad sense, any mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions is an equation. So, $\LARGE y=mx+b$ is an equation because it asserts that the expression $\LARGE y$ is equal to $\LARGE mx+b$.

- **Function:** This equation also defines a function because it specifies a relationship where each input value of $\LARGE x$ corresponds to exactly one output value of $\LARGE y$. In this context, $\LARGE y=f(x)=mx+b$ explicitly shows that $\LARGE y$ is a function of $\LARGE x$.

### Examples of Equations That Become Functions

1. **Linear Equations**:
   - **Equation:** $\LARGE y = 3x + 2$
   - **Function:** This is a function because for each $\LARGE x$, there is exactly one $\LARGE y$.

2. **Quadratic Equations**:
   - **Equation:** $\LARGE y = x^2$
   - **Function:** This is a function because for each $\LARGE x$, there is exactly one $\LARGE y$. The output is unique for every input.

3. **Rational Functions**:
   - **Equation:** $\LARGE y = \frac{1}{x}$
   - **Function:** This is a function because for each non-zero $\LARGE x$, there is exactly one $\LARGE y$. The function is undefined at $\LARGE x = 0$, but it still meets the criteria for being a function in its domain.

### Equations That Are Not Functions

1. **Circle Equation**:
   - **Equation:** $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$
   - **Not a Function:** This equation does not represent a function because for some values of $\LARGE x$, there are two corresponding values of $\LARGE y$. For example, when $\LARGE x = 0$, $\LARGE y$ can be either $\LARGE 1$ or $\LARGE -1$.

2. **Vertical Line Equation**:
   - **Equation:** $\LARGE x = 2$
   - **Not a Function:** This is not a function because it does not associate each $\LARGE x$ with a unique $\LARGE y$. Instead, it describes a vertical line where $\LARGE x$ is always $\LARGE 2$, and $\LARGE y$ can be any value.

### Transforming an Equation Into a Function

Sometimes, you can manipulate or restrict an equation to turn it into a function:

1. **Isolating the Dependent Variable**:
   - If an equation involves multiple variables, you might solve for one variable in terms of the others to create a function.
   - **Example:** The equation $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = 1$ can be transformed into two functions by solving for $\LARGE y$: 
     - $\LARGE y=\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $\LARGE y=-\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Each of these represents a function, but together, they cover both the upper and lower halves of the circle.

2. **Restricting the Domain**:
   - By restricting the domain of an equation, you can sometimes ensure that it satisfies the criteria of a function.
   - **Example:** The equation $\LARGE y = \sqrt{x}$ is a function if the domain is restricted to $\LARGE x \geq 0$. This restriction ensures that each $\LARGE x$ corresponds to exactly one $\LARGE y$.
## [[Parameters vs. Variables|Connecting Parameters and Variables in Functions and Equations]]

### Common Underlying Concept of Parameters

At a fundamental level, a **parameter** in mathematics is **a quantity that influences the behavior or outcome of a function or equation** but is not the primary variable being manipulated. Instead, parameters **define certain characteristics or set specific conditions** within which the primary variables operate.

### How These Concepts Are Related

The idea of parameters in both parametric functions and equations is deeply interconnected:

1. **Control and Description**:
   - In both contexts, parameters are used to **control** or **describe** a certain aspect of the mathematical object or relationship. They set the framework within which the primary variables operate.
   - In a parametric function, parameters like $\LARGE t$ or $\LARGE r$ control the path of a curve or the shape of a surface.
   - In an equation, parameters can set conditions like the size of a circle (through $\LARGE r$) or describe a family of possible solutions.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Parameters provide **flexibility** in mathematical modeling by allowing you to explore different scenarios without changing the fundamental nature of the function or equation.
   - In parametric functions, varying parameters lets you trace different curves or surfaces.
2. **Flexibility** (continued):
   - In equations, parameters let you analyze how solutions change under different conditions.

3. **Fixed vs. Variable Contexts**:
   - Whether in functions or equations, parameters are typically **fixed** within a given context but can be varied across different contexts or scenarios.
   - In parametric functions, parameters like $\LARGE t$ or $\LARGE r$ may be fixed for a given curve but can vary to describe different curves.
   - In equations, parameters like $\LARGE r$ (radius of a circle) are fixed to define a specific circle but can vary across different circles.

### Parameters in Functions

- **Definition and Role**:
  - In a function, a **parameter** is a variable that is fixed within the context of a specific problem but can vary across different problems or scenarios. Parameters help define the specific form or behavior of the function.
  - For example, in the function $\LARGE f(x) = ax + b$, the constants $\LARGE a$ and $\LARGE b$ are parameters. They control the slope and y-intercept of the line, respectively. While $\LARGE x$ varies freely as the input, $\LARGE a$ and $\LARGE b$ remain fixed for a given instance of the function.

- **Parameter Space and Parametric Functions**:
  - In **parametric functions**, parameters are used to describe a set of functions or curves. For example, consider the parametric equations of a circle: 
    - $\LARGE x(t) = \cos(t)$, 
    - $\LARGE y(t) = \sin(t)$.
    - Here, $\LARGE t$ is the parameter that varies over an interval (typically $\LARGE [0, 2\pi]$), and as it changes, it traces out the circle in the $xy$-plane. The parameters control the path described by the function.

- **Parameters in Higher Dimensions**:
  - Parameters in functions can define curves or surfaces in higher dimensions, mapping a one-dimensional input (the parameter) to points in a higher-dimensional space.

### Variables vs. Parameters in Equations

#### Variables:

- **Definition**: Variables in an equation are symbols that represent unknown quantities that can vary. The primary goal when dealing with equations is often to solve for these variables, finding the values that satisfy the equation.

- **Role**: Variables are typically the unknowns you are trying to solve for in an equation. They are not fixed and can take on different values depending on the conditions imposed by the equation.

- **Example**: In the equation $\LARGE x + 2y = 5$, $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$ are variables. The equation describes a relationship between these two variables.

#### Parameters:

- **Definition**: Parameters are special types of variables that are usually fixed for a particular problem or scenario but can vary across different problems. They define specific conditions or constraints within the equation.

- **Role**: Parameters are constants in the context of solving an equation, although they can be treated as variables when analyzing a family of equations or solutions. They help describe or control the behavior of the equation but are not the primary unknowns to solve for.

- **Example**: In the equation $\LARGE y = mx + b$, $\LARGE m$ and $\LARGE b$ are parameters that control the slope and y-intercept of the line. While $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$ are variables that can vary, $\LARGE m$ and $\LARGE b$ are treated as constants for a given line but can vary across different lines.

### When Do Variables Become Parameters?

**Context Matters**: Whether a variable is treated as a parameter depends on the context of the problem. When analyzing a single solution, variables are typically the unknowns. 
	When considering a family of solutions or conditions, some variables may become parameters to describe broader relationships.

#### Contextual Shift:

1. **Parameters in a Family of Solutions**:
   - In certain contexts, a variable can become a parameter when it is not the primary focus of solving the equation but rather serves to describe a family of solutions.
   - **Example**: Consider the system of equations:
     - $\LARGE x + 2y = 5$
     - If we solve for $\LARGE x$ in terms of $\LARGE y$, we get:
       - $\LARGE x = 5 - 2y$.
       - Here, $\LARGE y$ can be treated as a free variable or parameter. Instead of solving for $\LARGE y$, we let it vary freely, and for each value of $\LARGE y$, $\LARGE x$ is determined. In this context, $\LARGE y$ becomes a parameter that defines a family of solutions along a line in the $xy$-plane.

2. **Parameters in Constraints**:
   - Parameters can also appear in equations where they define fixed conditions or constraints.
   - **Example**: In the equation $\LARGE y = mx + b$, $\LARGE m$ and $\LARGE b$ are parameters that control the slope and y-intercept of the line.

### Distinguishing Between Variables and Parameters

The distinction lies in the role each variable plays.

#### Example: System of Equations

- **Equations**:
  - $\LARGE x + y = 2$
  - $\LARGE 2x + z = 3$
- **Solution**: You solved for $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE z$ in terms of $\LARGE y$:
  - $\LARGE x = 2 - y$, $\LARGE z = 2y - 1$.
  - Here, $\LARGE y$ can be considered a **parameter** because it is treated as a free variable that determines the values of $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE z$. This makes $\LARGE y$ a parameter in the context of this solution because it defines a family of solutions depending on the value of $\LARGE y$.

#### Why $\LARGE x$ in $\LARGE y=mx+b$ is Not a Parameter:

In the equation $\LARGE y=mx+b$, $\LARGE x$ is the **independent variable**, not a parameter. Here’s why:

- **Independent Variable**: In the function $\LARGE y=f(x)=mx+b$, $\LARGE x$ is the input to the function. The function maps each value of $\LARGE x$ to a corresponding value of $\LARGE y$. This makes $\LARGE x$ the independent variable.

- **Parameter Role**: The parameters in this context are $\LARGE m$ and $\LARGE b$, which control the slope and y-intercept of the line, respectively. They determine the specific form of the function, but they are not the primary inputs that the function maps.

- **Why Not a Parameter**: $\LARGE x$ is not a parameter because it is not setting or controlling the function’s form or behavior; it is the variable being input into the function to produce an output. A parameter, on the other hand, typically sets the conditions under which the function operates (e.g., the slope $\LARGE m$ and the intercept $\LARGE b$).

### Identifying When a Variable Becomes a Parameter in Functions

1. **Influence vs. Direct Output**: Parameters influence the behavior or characteristics of the function but are not directly the independent input variable (like $\LARGE x$) or the output.

2. **Fixed in Context**: Parameters are typically fixed for a specific instance of a function but can vary across different instances to produce a family of functions.

3. **Defining a Family**: Parameters allow the definition of a family of functions rather than a single specific function.

4. **Constants or Controlled Variables**: Parameters can act as constants within a specific context or as controlled variables that define different scenarios or outcomes.

### Identifying When a Variable Becomes a Parameter in Equations

The key to identifying when a variable becomes a parameter lies in understanding its role and context within the equation or function.

To identify when a variable in an equation becomes a parameter, consider the following:

1. **Is the Variable Free or Fixed?**
   - If the variable can take any value without being explicitly solved for, it is likely a parameter.

2. **Does the Variable Define a Family of Solutions?**
   - If changing the variable leads to different solutions within a system, it is acting as a parameter.

3. **Is the Variable Controlling the Equation’s Behavior?**
   - If the variable is not the main focus but instead controls aspects like the size, shape, or orientation of a geometric figure (e.g., radius in a circle), it is a parameter.

4. **Is the Variable in a Parametric Equation?**
   - In parametric equations, parameters explicitly define the curve or surface, making them parameters by design.

### Primary Variables

- **Definition**: Primary variables are the variables that are directly involved in the relationship or operation defined by an equation or function. These are the variables that you are typically solving for.

- **Role**: They represent the quantities that change or vary within the context of a problem. In a function, the primary variable is often the input (e.g., $\LARGE x$ in $\LARGE f(x)$). In an equation, primary variables are those that you are trying to determine the values of.

### Parameters

- **Definition**: A parameter is a variable that influences the form, position, or behavior of a function or equation but is not the primary variable you are solving for.

- **Role**: Parameters are often constants within the context of a specific problem or scenario, but they can vary across different problems. They set conditions or describe a family of solutions rather than being the direct focus of the solution process.

### Step 1: Determine the Focus of the Problem

- **Ask:** What are you trying to solve for?
  - If a variable is the main focus—meaning you are trying to find its value—then it is likely a **primary variable**.
  - If a variable is not the main focus and instead serves to define or control certain aspects of the equation or function, it might be a **parameter**.

### Step 2: Analyze the Role of the Variable

- **Ask:** Is the variable setting a condition, defining a shape, or controlling a family of solutions?
  - If the variable controls how the equation or function behaves or how it looks but is not being directly solved for, then it is a **parameter**.
  - **Example:** In $\LARGE y = mx + b$, $\LARGE m$ and $\LARGE b$ are parameters because they define the slope and intercept of the line, while $\LARGE x$ is the primary variable because you input values for $\LARGE x$ to get corresponding $\LARGE y$ values.

### Step 3: Look at the Variable's Flexibility

- **Ask:** Can the variable take on a range of values to describe different scenarios, or is it fixed for a specific case?
  - If the variable is used to describe a range of scenarios or solutions, it is likely a **parameter**.
  - If the variable's value is what you are solving for in a specific instance, it is a **primary variable**.

### Examples to Clarify the Pattern

#### Example 1: Linear Equation

- **Equation:** $\LARGE y = mx + b$
  - **Primary Variables:** $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$
  - **Parameters:** $\LARGE m$ (slope) and $\LARGE b$ (y-intercept)
  - **Pattern:** $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$ are the primary variables because they represent the inputs and outputs of the function. $\LARGE m$ and $\LARGE b$ are parameters because they control the line's slope and position.

#### Example 2: Circle Equation

- **Equation:** $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
  - **Primary Variables:** $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$
  - **Parameter:** $\LARGE r$ (radius)
  - **Pattern:** $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE y$ are the primary variables because you are finding points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation. $\LARGE r$ is a parameter because it defines the size of the circle but is not the focus of what you’re solving for.

#### Example 3: System of Equations with a Free Variable

- **System:** $\LARGE x + 2y = 4$
  - **Primary Variable:** $\LARGE x$
  - **Parameter:** $\LARGE y$ (if treated as a free variable)
  - **Pattern:** If you solve for $\LARGE x$ in terms of $\LARGE y$ ($\LARGE x = 4 - 2y$), then $\LARGE y$ becomes a parameter that can vary, describing a family of solutions. $\LARGE x$ is still a primary variable because it depends directly on the value of $\LARGE y$.

### Summary of the Pattern

1. **Focus:** If a variable is what you are solving for, it’s a primary variable. If it controls conditions or describes a scenario but is not the focus of the solution, it’s a parameter.
2. **Role:** If the variable sets a condition or defines a characteristic of the equation or function, it is a parameter.
3. **Flexibility:** If the variable can take on different values across a range of scenarios or solutions, it is likely a parameter.

- **Linear Systems**:
  - In a system of linear equations, if there are more variables than independent equations (an underdetermined system), some variables may be treated as parameters.
  - **Example:** Consider the system:
    - $\LARGE \begin{align*} x + y &= 2 \\ 2x + z &= 3 \end{align*}$
    - If we solve for $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE z$ in terms of $\LARGE y$, we might treat $\LARGE y$ as a parameter: $\LARGE x = 2 - y$, $\LARGE z = 2y - 1$.
    - Here, $\LARGE y$ is treated as a parameter that can vary freely, defining a family of solutions for $\LARGE x$ and $\LARGE z$.

- **Parametric Equations**:
  - In parametric equations, parameters are explicitly used to describe the variables.
  - **Example:** For a parametric equation of a circle:
    - $\LARGE x = r\cos(t)$, $\LARGE y = r\sin(t)$.
    - $\LARGE t$ is a parameter that varies over a specific interval, defining the position on the circle. $\LARGE r$ is also a parameter defining the radius of the circle.

### Parameters in Equations

Parameters in equations can act as free variables, leading to a family of solutions, or they can be fixed constants that set specific conditions the variables must satisfy.

- **Free Variables as Parameters**:
  - In the context of **equations**, especially systems of equations, parameters often appear when the system has free variables, leading to a family of solutions rather than a single solution.
  - **Example:** Consider the system:
    - $\LARGE x + 2y = 4$.
    - If we solve for $\LARGE x$, we can express it in terms of a free variable $\LARGE y = t$ (where $\LARGE t$ is a parameter): $\LARGE x=4−2t$. Here, $\LARGE t$ is a parameter that can take any real value, and for each $\LARGE t$, there is a corresponding value of $\LARGE x$. The parameter $\LARGE t$ defines a family of solutions.

- **Fixed Parameters in Constraints**:
  - In some cases, parameters in equations are fixed constants that define the constraints the variables must satisfy.
  - **Example:** In the equation $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, the parameter $\LARGE r$ represents the radius of the circle. It is fixed and determines the specific circle described by the equation.

- Unlike in functions, where parameters often help define a family of curves or surfaces, in equations, parameters can define the specific conditions that the solution set must satisfy.
### 1. Graphs as Representations of Sets of Solutions (Equations)

When you have an **equation**, it typically defines a **relationship** between variables. The **graph** of this equation represents the **set of solutions** — all the points that satisfy the equation. Think of it like this:

- Take the equation y=2x+5y = 2x + 5y=2x+5. The graph of this equation is a straight line.
- Every point (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) on the line is a **solution** to the equation. For example, the point (1,7)(1, 7)(1,7) satisfies y=2x+5y = 2x + 5y=2x+5, because if you plug in x=1x = 1x=1, you get y=7y = 7y=7. Similarly, (−1,3)(-1, 3)(−1,3) is also a solution, since y=2(−1)+5=3y = 2(-1) + 5 = 3y=2(−1)+5=3.

The **graph** of the equation is essentially the **visual representation** of **all the pairs of values** (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) that satisfy the equation. This set of points forms the **set of solutions**.

### 2. Graphs as Representations of Mappings (Functions)

Now, consider the **function** interpretation of the graph. When you think of a graph as a function, you are focusing on the **mapping** between the independent variable (say xxx) and the dependent variable (say yyy).

In a function, every value of xxx has a corresponding value of yyy. The **graph** of a function shows you how this mapping works:

- For every value of xxx, the graph tells you what the value of yyy is, based on the function. For example, if y=2x+5y = 2x + 5y=2x+5, then for x=1x = 1x=1, the function tells you that y=7y = 7y=7.
- You can think of the graph as **plotting** this mapping of pairs (x,y)(x, y)(x,y), showing how each xxx is mapped to a unique yyy.

### Key Insight: Set of Solutions vs. Mapping of Pairs

At first glance, it can be hard to separate the concept of a **set of solutions** from the **mapping of pairs** because they are visually represented in the same way — both are simply **points on a graph**. But here’s the difference:

1. **Set of Solutions** (Equation):
    - The graph of an equation is the set of all points (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) that **satisfy** the equation.
    - There is no inherent direction in this representation. It’s a **static collection** of points that fulfill the condition of the equation.
2. **Mapping of Pairs** (Function):
    - The graph of a function shows how each xxx is **mapped** to a specific yyy. It’s more **dynamic** because for each xxx, you can find the corresponding yyy.
    - In this interpretation, the graph is a way of seeing the **relationship** between xxx and yyy — how yyy changes as xxx changes.

### Why This Feels Tricky:

- **Visually**, the graph looks the same whether you're interpreting it as a **set of solutions** or as a **mapping** of pairs. Both interpretations are about the same set of points on the graph.
- The difference lies in **how you interpret those points**. In the **set of solutions** view, you’re focusing on the fact that these points satisfy a given equation. In the **mapping of pairs** view, you're focusing on how one variable (the independent one) determines the other (the dependent one).

### 3. A Practical Example: Circle

Let’s take the equation of a circle:

x2+y2=r2x^2 + y^2 = r^2x2+y2=r2

The graph of this equation is a circle. Here’s how to think about it:

- As a **set of solutions**, this equation describes all the pairs (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) that satisfy the condition x2+y2=r2x^2 + y^2 = r^2x2+y2=r2. The graph is just the **collection** of all these pairs — all the points that lie on the circle.
    
- However, it’s difficult to write this in a **function** form for all values of xxx because it’s not always possible to express yyy as a single function of xxx over the whole domain (you would need two functions, one for the upper half of the circle and one for the lower half). So in this case, thinking of the graph as a **set of solutions** is more natural.
    

### 4. A Line Example (Function and Set of Solutions)

Now, consider the linear function y=2x+5y = 2x + 5y=2x+5:

- **Set of Solutions**: The graph is a straight line, and it represents the collection of all points (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) that satisfy y=2x+5y = 2x + 5y=2x+5. Any point on this line is a solution to the equation.
    
- **Mapping of Pairs**: The graph is also a visual representation of the **mapping** from xxx to yyy. For each xxx, you can trace up or down to the line and find the corresponding yyy. It shows you how yyy changes as xxx changes.
    

### 5. Bridging the Gap: Dual Interpretations

When you're looking at the graph:

- As a **set of solutions**, you’re viewing it as a **static collection of points** that all satisfy a certain equation. You’re not necessarily thinking about how xxx maps to yyy.
    
- As a **function** (mapping of pairs), you’re seeing it more **dynamically** — each value of xxx is associated with exactly one yyy, and you can trace this relationship along the curve.
    

Both views are true at the same time! The graph encodes both the **set of solutions** and the **mapping of pairs** because those are two ways of interpreting the same mathematical object.

### Conclusion

To summarize:

- **Set of solutions** refers to all the points (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) that satisfy an equation, and this is represented by the graph.
- **Mapping of pairs** (function) refers to how the graph shows the relationship between xxx and yyy, with yyy depending on xxx.

In essence, both views are embedded in the graph — the graph is a bridge between the **geometric (visual)** view of equations and the **functional (dynamic)** view of mappings. They are two sides of the same coin. It’s just a matter of interpreting the points on the graph in different ways depending on whether you are thinking of an equation or a function.
