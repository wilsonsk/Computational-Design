$$\LARGE \vec{r}(t), \quad \vec{r}(t) = [x(t),\space y(t),\space z(t)]$$
$$\LARGE \text{Where $\vec{r}$ is a Vector-Valued Function, and $t$ is a parameter.}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And $x(t), \space y(t), \space z(t)$ are Component Scalar Functions, $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$} $$
The Scalars returned by these component scalar functions compose the "points" of the returned vector. 
###### $\LARGE t$ as a Parameter
In the context of the parametric function $\vec{r}(t)$, where $\vec{r}(t)$ is typically a vector-valued function describing a curve or path in space, the variable $t$ is identified as a parameter.
## To Find the "Parametrization of a Curve"
Means to establish (two or three) component functions ($\LARGE x(t), y(t), z(t)$) of $\LARGE \vec{r}(t), \quad \vec{r}(t) = [x(t),\space y(t),\space z(t)]$.

$$\LARGE \text{The Parametrization: } \quad (x(t), y(t)) = (t, f(t)), \quad t \in [a,b]$$
You simply define the independent variable $\LARGE x$ equal to the parameter, $\LARGE t$ (i.e. the component function $\LARGE x(t) = t$).
	Then define make the second component function (i.e. dependent variable) a **function of the parameter $t$** (i.e. the component function $\LARGE y(t) = f(t)$).

### A single curve can have many "parametrizations".
