# Axes and Dimensions
An axis is a **conceptual dimension**, where the "value" along the axis corresponds to different states or outcomes of a system. 
	It doesn't have to be spatial at all.
		 It’s about representing the **[[Degrees of Freedom|degrees of freedom]]** or **[[Degrees of Freedom#Parameters and Degrees of Freedom|parameters]]** that define your system’s behavior.

An **axis** is essentially a **set of possibilities** or a **range of values** for some variable, just like a set defines possible elements. 
	An axis can be thought of as a **range** in which the system can exist or evolve, and it doesn’t need to be limited to physical space.
### Dimensions and Axes as Sets of Possible Values (Codomains)
Each axis in a coordinate system (whether it's 1D, 2D, 3D, or higher-dimensional) corresponds to a **range of values** that a variable can take. 
	These sets of possible values are often described as the **codomain** or **domain** of a function.
###### Dimension/Axis
In a Cartesian plane, each axis (e.g., $x$-axis, $y$-axis, etc.) represents the set of all possible values that the corresponding variable can take.
###### Codomain
If we think abstractly, each axis is really a **codomain** (or domain), which is the set of all values that the dependent variable could map to. 
	For example, in $\LARGE y=f(x)$, the set of all possible $y$-values forms the **codomain** of the function $f$.

So, dimensions or axes are essentially **possibilities** — they define the **space** or **range** in which variables can exist.
#### Equations as Constraints on Those Possibilities (Codomains, i.e. Axes)
Equations serve to **constrain** or **limit** the possibilities defined by the axes. 
	When you have multiple dimensions (e.g., $x$-axis and $y$-axis in a plane), the equation introduces a **relationship** between those dimensions.

For instance:
	In the equation of a circle $\LARGE x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, both $x$ and $y$ can take on any values from their respective axes (dimensions), but the **equation** constrains the possible pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy this condition. 
		The equation restricts the values of $x$ and $y$ so that they must lie on the circle.

In this sense, **equations** are rules or conditions that **carve out specific subsets** of possibilities from the larger set of potential values on the axes. 
	They act like **filters** that limit what combinations of variables are allowed.
#### Converting Equations into Functions to Define Relationships
Once you have an equation that **constrains** the possible values of variables (i.e., the possibilities on the axes), you can often (but not always) **convert that equation into a function**. 
	When you do this, you're essentially **isolating** one variable (say, $y$) and expressing it as a function of another variable (say, $x$).

- For example, from the equation of a line $\LARGE y=2x+5$, you're expressing $y$ as a function of $x$, which establishes a direct **relationship** between the variables.

In this process, you're not just identifying a set of possibilities (as the equation does) — you're making **explicit the relationship** between those possibilities. 
	The function defines how, for any given value of $x$, there is a corresponding value of $y$, effectively defining the **mapping** between the dimensions (axes).

In parametric design, this is especially powerful because functions allow you to:
1. **Explore** the behavior of systems by varying inputs (independent variables).
2. **Understand** how changes in one variable affect others (dependent variables).
3. **Model** complex relationships in a more dynamic and manipulable way than with equations alone.
#### Equations and Functions in the Context of Axes (Possibilities/Codomains/Axes)
Equations are **static** constraints that describe a condition (like a circle, ellipse, or line) on the possible values of variables in different dimensions. 
	Functions, on the other hand, provide a **dynamic** description of how one dimension varies with another, defining the precise **relationship** between the variables.

So, to summarize the sequence you're describing:
1. **Axes** (or dimensions) are sets of possible values, defining the range of possibilities for each variable.
2. **Equations** impose **constraints** on those possibilities, limiting the combinations of values that can exist together.
3. **Functions** (derived from equations) express the **relationships** between variables, describing how one variable depends on another.
