# Weight as a Force and Gravity as Acceleration
## Force as the Product of Mass and Acceleration (aka Force *of* the Product of Mass and Acceleration)
### [[Division#Division as a Proportional Relationship (i.e. Direct Proportionality)|Proportionality]]
The [[Newton's Second Law#Force|force]] is [[Division#Direct Proportionality|directly proportional]] to the scaling of [[Newton's First Law#Mass|mass]] by [[Newton's Second Law#Acceleration|acceleration]].
	Therefore, if a mass is constant, then force is directly proportional to acceleration.
		I.e. For a given mass, if the acceleration increases, the force increases proportionally.
			 And if the acceleration decreases, the force decreases proportionally.
	And if acceleration is constant, then force is directly proportional to mass.
		 Similarly, for a given acceleration, if the mass increases, the force increases proportionally. 
			 And if the mass decreases, the force decreases proportionally.

### Two Different Balls with Different Masses

#### Falling: [[Newton's First Law#Newton's Universal Law of Gravitational Force|Gravity]] *as* Constant Acceleration
The [[Uniform Acceleration#Uniform Acceleration|acceleration]] of the balls is **mass independent**.
	Notice that the magnitude of this acceleration *is* **gravity** in the negative z direction (via standard unit vector).
		Therefore, Gravity itself is **not** the force itself. 
			But rather, Gravity is the constant acceleration component of the Force. 
				Gravity is the phenomenon where a mass accelerates (in a constant rate) towards another mass. 
					Near the Earth's surface, this acceleration is approximately $9.8 , \text{m/s}^2$ and is denoted by $g$.

If we equate the equations of $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{F_{gravity}}$ we can see that the acceleration of an object in the "downward" or negative z direction, is Gravity.
$$\LARGE F= m \cdot a \text{ and } F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot g$$
$$\LARGE m \cdot a = m \cdot g$$
$$\text{Canceling } m \text{ from both sides } \frac{m}{m} a = \frac{m}{m}g$$
$$\LARGE = a = g$$
[[#Linearity in the Field of Real Numbers 1. Proportionality Proportionality|Remember that if Acceleration is constant]] (in this case it is, as Gravity), then the Force (in this case of Gravity) is directly proportional to the mass of an object.
#### Falling: Force *of* Gravity *as* [[Newton's First Law#Weight and Gravity Weight (i.e. the "downward" Force acting on an Object due to Gravity) Weight|Weight]]
Remember that Gravity *is* the Constant Acceleration in the "downward" or negative z direction.
	Therefore, $\LARGE \mathbf{F_{\text{gravity}}} = \mathbf{m} \cdot -\mathbf{g}$
		Because the Gravity (as constant acceleration) is negative (due to the direction along the negative z axis), the scaling of this with the mass, produces a negative Force (of Gravity) in the same direction.
###### Weight (i.e. the "downward" Force acting on an Object due to Gravity)
Refers to the "downward" force acting on the object due to constant acceleration of gravity.
	Weight can be defined as a vector quantity, the Force of Gravity acting on the object. 
		Weight can also be defined as a scalar quantity, the magnitude of the Force of Gravity on the object.Â 

$\LARGE W = mg$
Where $W$ is weight.
	Where $m$ is mass.
	Where $g$ is [[Newton's Second Law#Acceleration|acceleration]] due to gravity.

Therefore if $\LARGE F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot g$
	Then $\LARGE F_{\text{gravity}} = W$
#### Lifting: Two Different Balls with Different Masses
When lifting objects, we need to apply a force to overcome *Force of* Gravity ($\large F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot - g$). 
	The force required to lift an object is given by:
$$\LARGE F_{\text{lift}} = m \cdot g$$
Here, $m$ is the mass of the object.
	Because Gravity (as Acceleration) is constant:
		Heavier objects (larger $m$) require more force to lift because $F_{\text{lift}}$ is directly proportional to $m$. 
			This is why lifting a heavier object feels more difficult compared to lifting a lighter one.

Overcoming Gravity to Lift an Object:

Starting to Lift:
To start lifting an object (i.e., to accelerate it upward), $F_{\text{lift}}$ must be greater than $F_{\text{gravity}}$. 
This means applying a force greater than the gravitational force to provide the necessary upward acceleration.

Lifting at Constant Velocity:
Once the object is moving upward at constant velocity, the forces must balance.
At this point, $F_{\text{lift}} = F_{\text{gravity}}$, and the net force is zero, resulting in no acceleration.

Equation for Equilibrium:
$F_{\text{lift}} - F_{\text{gravity}} = 0$

Summary:
To Lift an Object:
$F_{\text{lift}}$ must initially be greater than $F_{\text{gravity}}$ to overcome inertia and start the upward movement.
Once moving at a constant velocity, $F_{\text{lift}} = F_{\text{gravity}}$ to maintain that constant velocity.

Equilibrium:
For an object to remain at rest or move at constant velocity, the net force must be zero:
$F_{\text{lift}} - F_{\text{gravity}} = 0 \Rightarrow F_{\text{lift}} = F_{\text{gravity}}$

> [!note] ### Inertia
> Inertia is the tendency of objects in motion to stay in motion and objects at rest to stay at rest, unless a force causes its speed or direction to change. 
> 	I.e. The tendency of an object to resist changes in their state of motion. 
> 		The greater the inertia, the more force is required to change the object's state of motion (either to start moving, stop moving, or change direction).
