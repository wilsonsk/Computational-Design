# Forces of the Pulley
Are used to **reorient** forces.
	Pulleys enable the change of the direction of the necessary applied force.
		And Pulleys enable the change of the magnitude of the necessary applied force.
## Fixed Pulley
A Fixed Pulley (i.e. fixed at its axis) does not change the applied Force (red) necessary to lift the object.
	But it does change the Direction of the applied force (negative z direction).

## Movable Pulley
A non-fixed (i.e. not fixed at its axis) or Movable Pulley itself moves when a force (red) is applied. 
	Consider the change of **position** of the now movable pulley.
		The magnitude of the applied force is now 1/2 the downward force (weight) of the object.
			But to change the position of the object is only 1/2 the length pulled.
