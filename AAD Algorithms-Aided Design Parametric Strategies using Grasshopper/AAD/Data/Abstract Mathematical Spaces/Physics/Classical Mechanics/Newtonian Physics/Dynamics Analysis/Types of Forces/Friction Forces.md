# Friction Force, $F_F$
A science on its own.

Friction Force **stops the motion**, and **counteracts motion**.
## Microscopic Origin
![[Pasted image 20240807071924.png]]
In the case of equilibrium, at a microscopic level there are Normal Reactionary Forces in all different directions, and the Resultant Force would then cancel out and not move.
## Macroscopic Perspective
We call this a Friction Force that counter acts every motion.
### Friction Constant, $\LARGE \micro$
The friction constant, often denoted as μ\muμ (the Greek letter "mu"), represents the coefficient of friction between two surfaces. 

There are two types of coefficients of friction:
#### Coefficient of Static Friction ($\LARGE \mu_s$)
This coefficient applies when the surfaces are not moving relative to each other.
	It represents the maximum frictional force that must be overcome to start the motion.
		The frictional force $F_F$ is given by: $\LARGE F_F = \mu_s F_N$
			Where $F_N$ is the normal force.
#### Coefficient of Kinetic Friction ($\mu_k$​)
This coefficient applies when the surfaces are sliding past each other.
	It represents the frictional force that opposes the motion while the surfaces are moving.
		The frictional force $\LARGE F_F$ is given by: $\LARGE F_F = \mu_k F_N$​
			Where $F_N$ is the normal force.
#### Factors Affecting the Coefficient of Friction

- **Material**: Different materials have different coefficients of friction when interacting with each other. For example, rubber on concrete has a high coefficient of friction, while ice on metal has a low coefficient.
- **Surface Roughness**: Rougher surfaces generally have higher coefficients of friction compared to smoother surfaces.
- **Temperature**: Temperature can affect the properties of the materials and thus the coefficient of friction.
- **Presence of Lubricants**: Lubricants can significantly reduce the coefficient of friction between surfaces.
### Types of Friction
Depend on the type of motion, an object with initial motion or and object with non motion, etc.

#### Coulomb Friction (I.e. Dry Friction)
**Coulomb friction** is a term that encompasses both static and kinetic friction, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who studied and formulated the laws of friction. 
	Dry friction, also known as Coulomb friction, refers to the frictional force that resists the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact.
		 It is distinguished from fluid friction (which occurs in fluids such as liquids or gases) and rolling friction.
			  Coulomb friction encompasses both static and kinetic friction.

**It is angle dependent, material dependent, and motion dependent.**
The two primary types of Coulomb friction forces are static friction and kinetic friction.
	However, there are additional specific types of friction that can be considered under different circumstances.
##### Static Friction, $\LARGE F_{f,\text{static}}$
The frictional force that resists the initiation of motion between two surfaces that are in contact and at rest relative to each other.
	Describes the friction when an object is still stationary.
		A small $\alpha$ and relatively "dry" surfaces.
			This is the frictional force that prevents an object from starting to move.
				 It adjusts based on the applied force up to a maximum limit.
###### Variable Nature of Static Friction
Static friction adjusts to match the applied force up to its maximum value. 
	If an object is at rest, the static friction force will counterbalance any applied force up to a certain limit.
		The static friction force adjusts to counteract any applied force trying to move the object, up to its maximum limit. 
			This means if you apply a small force, static friction will provide an equal and opposite force to keep the object stationary, hence why it is Friction Force is derived from the Normal Force extending from the reactionary object.
				 If you gradually increase the applied force, the static friction force will increase correspondingly until it reaches its maximum value, beyond which the object will start to move.
	
This force must be overcome to initiate motion.
$$\LARGE F_{F,\text{static}} \leq \mu_s$$
$\LARGE \mu_s$: Coefficient aka Constant of static friction.
$F_N$: Normal force.

This inequality means that the static friction force can vary from zero up to its maximum value, depending on the applied force. 
	The object does not move as long as the applied force is less than or equal to the maximum static friction force.
###### Behavior of Static Friction
Static friction adjusts to match the applied force up to a maximum limit.
	Static friction can provide just enough force to counteract any applied force trying to move the object, up to a certain maximum limit. 
		This is why static friction can vary or "adjust" based on the applied force.
			- **No Applied Force**: If there is no applied force, the static friction force is zero because there is no need to counteract any force.
			- **Increasing Applied Force**: As an external force is applied to the object, the static friction force increases to match it, preventing the object from moving.
				- **Example**: If an applied force of $10 \, \text{N}$ is exerted on the object, the static friction force will also be $10 \, \text{N}$ to keep the object at rest.
			- **Maximum Limit**: When the applied force reaches the max of the static friction, then the static friction force also reaches its maximum value. 
				- Any further increase in the applied force will overcome the static friction, causing the object to start moving.
###### Maximum Static Friction
This is the maximum force that static friction can exert before the object starts to move.
	If the applied force exceeds this value, the object will start to move.
		The maximum force that static friction can exert is given by: 
$$\LARGE F_{F,\text{static, max}} = \mu_s F_N$$
###### Range of Static Friction
The range of static friction refers to the fact that the static friction force can be any value from zero up to its maximum value, depending on the magnitude of the applied force.
$$\LARGE 0 \leq F_{F,\text{static}} \leq \mu_s F_N$$
###### Transition to Kinetic Friction
Once the applied force exceeds the maximum static friction force ($\LARGE \mu_s F_N$), the object begins to move, and kinetic friction takes over. 
	Kinetic friction has a constant value given by:
$$\LARGE F_{F,\text{kinetic}} = \micro_kF_N$$
##### Kinetic Friction, $\LARGE F_{f,\text{kinetic}}$
The frictional force that resists the relative motion between two surfaces that are in contact and moving past each other.
	This is the frictional force acting on an object in motion.
		 Unlike static friction, kinetic friction has a constant value once the object is moving.
###### Behavior of Kinetic Friction
Kinetic friction is usually less than maximum static friction and has a constant value once motion starts.
###### Constant Nature of Kinetic Friction 
Once the object is in motion, the kinetic friction force becomes constant.
	The kinetic friction force is directly proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of kinetic friction. 
		This force opposes the motion of the object.
$$\LARGE F_{F,\text{kinetic}} = \micro_kF_N$$
The kinetic friction force is directly proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of kinetic friction. 
	This force opposes the motion of the object, and describes a constant force opposing motion.

## Friction Forces on an Inclined Plane
### Obtain the [[Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Physics/Classical Mechanics/Newtonian Physics/Dynamics Analysis/Types of Forces/Normal Force#Forces of an Inclined Plane|Forces of the Inclined Plane]]
As done before without the consideration of friction.
	That is the components of the Gravitational Force of an Object.
		And the Normal Force of the Reactionary resting object's surface.
#### Frictional Force
The frictional force $\vec{F}_f$​ acts parallel to the inclined plane and opposes the motion.
	The frictional force $F_f$ is given by the [[#Friction Constant, $ LARGE micro$|friction constant]] scaled by the Normal Force.
$$\LARGE F_F = \mu F_N = \mu mg \cos(\theta)$$
#### Summing the Forces to Find the Resultant Force
###### Parallel Direction
Net force in the parallel direction: 
$$\LARGE F_{\text{net},\parallel} = F_{G,\parallel} - F_F$$
$$\LARGE F_{\text{net},\parallel} = mg \sin(\theta) - \mu mg \cos(\theta)$$
###### Perpendicular Direction
Net force in the perpendicular direction: 
	Note there is no friction in the perpendicular direction.
$$\LARGE F_{\text{net},\perp} = F_N - F_{G,\perp}$$
$$\LARGE F_{\text{net},\perp} = mg \cos(\theta) - mg \cos(\theta) = 0$$
### Resultant Force
The resultant force is primarily in the direction parallel to the inclined plane:

$$\LARGE F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{net},\parallel} = mg \sin(\theta) - \mu mg \cos(\theta)$$
#### Direction and Magnitude of the Resultant Force
###### The Magnitude of the Resultant Force
$$\LARGE F_{\text{net}} = |mg \sin(\theta) - \mu mg \cos(\theta)$$
- **Direction**: The direction of the resultant force is along the inclined plane. This is due to the combination of the parallel component of the gravitational force and the opposing frictional force (if friction is present).
