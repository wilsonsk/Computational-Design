# Newton's Third Law (i.e. Law of Action and Reaction)
**"To every action there is always opposed and equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts."**
	"For any action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

I.e. Whenever you push on something, it pushes back on you with the same amount of force, but in the opposite direction. 
	This means that forces always come in pairs: one force acts on one object, and the other force acts on another object, both being equal in strength but opposite in direction.

### Action and Reaction Forces
By "action" Newton meant a force, so for every force one body exerts on another body, that second body exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction back on the first body. 
	Since all forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or indirectly), all forces come in pairs, one acting on each of the bodies interacting.
		Though there may be two equal and opposite forces acting on a single body, it is important to remember that for each of the forces a Third Law pair acts on a separate body. 
			This can sometimes be confusing when there are multiple Third Law pairs at work. 

These two forces are added together and either sum to 0 or non zero, in which case a resulting force has been generated (as in an [[Normal Force#Forces of an Inclined Plane|inclined plane]].
#### Action Force
This is the initial force exerted by one object on another.
	For example, if you push against a wall, the force your hand applies to the wall is the action force.
#### Reaction Force
This is the force exerted by the second object back on the first object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the action force.
	In the example above, the force that the wall applies back on your hand is the reaction force.
#### Characteristics of Action and Reaction Forces
- **Equal Magnitude**: The forces are equal in strength.
- **Opposite Direction**: The forces act in opposite directions.
- **Different Objects**: The forces act on two different objects. The action force acts on the second object, and the reaction force acts on the first object.
- **Simultaneous**: The forces occur simultaneously.
## Examples

This volleyball resting on a surface has two pairs of Third Law forces.
	1. The first consists of the gravitational forces (one force on the ball and one force on the ground). 
	2. The second consists of the normal forces at the point of contact (one force on the ball and one force on the ground).

	If we ignore the weight of the two objects, this clamp will also have two pairs of Third Law forces. 
	1. The first will be a set of normal forces at the top point of contact (one force on the wood and one force on the clamp).
	2. The second will be another set of normal forces at the bottom point of contact (one force on the wood and one force on the clamp).
