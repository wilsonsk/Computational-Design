# Forces Acting on a [[Circular Motion Examples#1. Pendulum Swing|Pendulum]]
![[Pasted image 20240806140803.png|400]]
Where the length of the rope is fixed $l$.
The mass $m$ can only move on a circular trajectory.
Rope compensates the force along the radial direction $F_{\text{rope}}$.
	The rope is what is exerting equal and opposite force relative to the force of the object (as acceleration due to gravity). 
		When the Resulting Force = $0$ then the system is in equilibrium.

When the [[Newton's Third Law#Action and Reaction Forces|action and reaction forces]] are no longer parallel to each other, then the resulting force along the tangential direction $F$ and is non-zero.
	Gravitational Force of the object still "downward".
		However, now the reactionary force of the rope, is now "along" the direction of the rope and thus the two forces are no longer parallel. 
			Therefore, the produce a non-zero resulting force that is tangential to the circular motion and in the opposite direction of the motion.
### Integrating to Obtain Acceleration, Velocity and Position
$$\LARGE F_{\text{resulting force}} = -F_g\sin(\varphi)e_s$$
$$\LARGE m \ddot{s}e_s = -mg\sin(\varphi) e_s$$$$\LARGE \ddot{s} = -g\sin(\varphi)$$
*Note*: Where $s$ is the [[Circular Motion#Arc s|arc length]] and $\LARGE s = l\cdot\varphi$ in which  $l$ is the [[Division#Constant of Direct Proportionality is a Constant Ratio ($ LARGE k$)|proportionality constant]]
	Therefore: 
$$\LARGE \dot{s}= \dot{l} \cdot \dot{\varphi}$$
$$\LARGE \ddot{s}= \ddot{l} \cdot \ddot{\varphi}$$
Replacing $\LARGE \ddot{s}$ with $\LARGE \ddot{l} \cdot \ddot{\varphi}$:
$$\LARGE \ddot{l}\cdot \ddot{\varphi} = -g\sin(\varphi)$$
$$\LARGE \frac{\ddot{l}}{\ddot{l}}\cdot \ddot{\varphi} = \frac{g}{\ddot{l}}\sin(\varphi)$$
$$\LARGE \ddot{\varphi} = \frac{g}{\ddot{l}}\sin(\varphi)$$
