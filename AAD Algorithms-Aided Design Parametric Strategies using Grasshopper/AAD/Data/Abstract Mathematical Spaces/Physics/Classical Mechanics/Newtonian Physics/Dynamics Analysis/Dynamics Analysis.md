# Dynamics Analysis
## The Study of how to Learn and Make Predictions Based on Physics Related [[Parameters|Parameters]] (i.e. make predictions)
As a means to **predict the future** from the present.
	I.e. Physics utilizes the measurement of changes in the current state of a system to accurately predict future state changes.

## All Physics is a Consideration of Two Aspects
Each aspect has an associated "way" of describing itself. 
1. [[#Present|Present]]/Initial state.
	- [[#Kinematics Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]].
2. [[#Future|Future]]/changed state.
	- [[#Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]]. 
## Defining the Context
What does:
###### "[[#Scale|Scale]]" mean?
The Scale defines the possible measurable properties that define a state.
###### "[[#State|State]]" mean?
The State defines the initial properties from which change can be defined. 
###### "[[#Change|Change]]" mean?
The Change defines the "present" and "future" states. 
###### "[[#Measurement|Measurement]]" mean?
###### "[[#1. Present|Present]]" mean?  
###### "[[#2. Future|Future]]" mean?

### The Abstract, Non-Physical [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces|Environment (i.e. Abstract Mathematical Spaces)]]
### The [[Abstract Mathematical Objects|Objects]] that Model the Subject Under Study
Are **Abstract Mathematical Objects**, and therefore, exist within an abstract, non-physical space as elements of the [[#Underlying Set (i.e. Base Set)|underlying set]].
### Scale
Scale refers to the relative size, extent, or magnitude of physical quantities or phenomena as measured or observed in different contexts or frameworks (i.e. Newtonian or Quantum scales, etc.). 
	The Scale determines the measurable [[#State|state]] of the objects defined within it. 

A **mathematical scale** is **defined** by or **within** its [[#The Abstract, Non-Physical Abstract Mathematical Objects Abstract, Non-Physical Environments Environment|abstract mathematical environment]]. 
	Scale is a **conceptual tool** that allows physicists to categorize and compare different physical systems based on their sizes, energies, times, or any other dimensional attributes. 

Each of These [[#Defining the Context|Terms]] Has a Different Meaning Depending on the Context of 

**Micro Scale = [[Quantum Mechanics|Quantum]] [[Quantum Mechanics|Scale]]**
**Macro Scale = [[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian]] [[Newtonian Mechanics#Scale|Scale]]**
### State
Refers to a comprehensive description of the condition of a system at a given moment.
	This description includes all the necessary information to determine the system's past or future behavior under specific conditions. 

Is a set of **values** or **properties** or **[[Parameters|parameters]]** that encapsulates all the relevant physical attributes necessary to describe the system fully at any specific point in time. 
	These attributes can vary depending on the nature of the system and the scale at which it is being observed.
### Change
#### [[Newton's Second Law#Motion|Motion]] as Change
In the broadest sense, change is considered the motion that measure between different states of a system.
	Specifically, a change in **position** over **time**.

It is the expression of non-physical and physical processes and interactions.

This definition holds across the various scales of the systems.
#### [[Transformations/Transformations|Transformations]]
###### [[Newton's Second Law#Translation Transformation|Translational Motion]]
Dynamics studies how and why bodies move from one place to another under the influence of forces. 
	This includes analyzing linear trajectories, acceleration, deceleration, and other aspects of translational motion. 
		The transformations in this context describe why and how the position of a body changes over time, directly tied to concepts like velocity and acceleration.
###### [[Newton's Second Law#Rotational Motion|Rotational Motion]]
Similarly, dynamics also explores rotational motion, where bodies turn about an axis. This includes studying angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torques. Rotational transformations in dynamics help describe changes in the orientation of a body, which are influenced by applied torques and rotational inertia.
###### Force and Motion Equations
Dynamics often utilizes Newton’s second law of motion (F = ma) in both its linear form and its rotational counterpart (τ = Iα, where τ is torque, I is moment of inertia, and α is angular acceleration). These equations relate forces and motions through dynamic transformations.
#### Time as a Measure of Change
Is a fundamental dimension in physics that enables us to sequence events, measure the duration of events, and quantify the intervals/rates between them. 

It is a scalar quantity that is continuous and unidirectional, often considered as flowing from past through present to future. 

Time provides the framework within which change occurs—it acts as the independent variable in most dynamical equations that describe how a system evolves.
#### [[Derivatives|Acceleration]] Vs [[Limits#Average Velocity|Velocity]]
Velocity is the rate of change of the **position** of some object.

[[Newton's Second Law#Acceleration|Acceleration]] is the rate of change of that **velocity** of the object.
### Measurement
Refers to the process of quantitatively determining the properties or state of an object or phenomenon.

The property or characteristic being measured, such as length, time, mass, temperature, velocity, or energy. 
	Each quantity is defined according to standard definitions and units that provide consistency across measurements.

It involves the collection of data through observation and interaction with the system using instruments and methodologies that provide quantifiable results. 
### 1. Present
A **state** (static set) of **initial** **conditions** or **parameters** (before a change in any of their values).
#### [[Kinematics Analysis|Kinematics Analysis]]: Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) [[#State|State]] (of condition, [[Parameters|parameters]]).
It is a complete **description** of an initial **state**. 
	A **list** of only the most **pertinent**, relevant and causal **initial conditions**.

A list of the most **fundamental information** about the **system** at the **initial time**, needed to be able to predict a future outcome within that system.

Identify only the most meaningful information - that is - limit the amount of information to only the necessary.

**Does not consider causality**.
	Kinematics deals with the description of motion without regard to its causes
##### Kinematics are Different in [[Newtonian Mechanics#Analysis Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ). Kinematics|Newtonian/Classical Kinematics]] and [[Quantum Mechanics#Analysis Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ). Kinematics|Quantum Kinematics]]

### 2. Future
The **state** of those **initial** **conditions**/**parameters** **"after"** an **interval** (i.e. change) in variable **time**, $t$.
- The values of such conditions/parameters have to potential to change (i.e. have different values) or remain the same, with a given change/interval in time.
#### Dynamics: "Explains" the Causality of a State Change
**Describes** the **state change**.
And also seeks to **explain the causality** related to **forces** and **torques**.
##### Dynamics are Different in  [[Newtonian Mechanics#Analysis 1. Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ). Kinematics|Newtonian/Classical Kinematics]] and [[Quantum Mechanics#Analysis Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change Dynamics|Quantum Dynamics]]

## The Strategy of Analysis
### From one or two fundamental laws/principles, learn to deduce everything
Protects from becoming dependent on memorizing equations. 
	Therefore, follow the logic and reasoning to make it derivable. 
###  Application: Decomposing an Newtonian/Classical Mechanics Problem
#### *Example*: A point on the $x-axis$
##### Goal I: [[#Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]]: Identify the Initial State of Object Within its System

###### 1. Identify the Object/Model
###### 2. Define the Initial State of this Object
Identify what constitutes the [[#1. Present]] - that is - that [[#State|state]] of the object.
	I.e. Identify what constitutes the most maximal [[#State|information]] about this present state.
		1. Place an **origin** on the $x-axis$.
		2. Place **[[|distance]]** **markers** on the $x-axis$.
			- This enables the [[Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Abstract Mathematical Objects/Measurement|measurement]] of distance.
				- And therefore, enables a **[[Position|position]]** (i.e. location).
	- Don't forget to translate units. 
##### The Result
Is an **object** at a given **initial / instant** with an **location**.
##### Goal II: [[#Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]]: Identify the Change Between Two States
###### The Application of [[Limits|Calculus]]: The [[Limits#Average Velocity|Limit of the Average Velocity]] (i.e. Average Rate of Change)
The [[Derivatives#|derivative]] *is* the **[[Limits#Limit of the Average Rate of Change|limit]]** of the **average velocity**.
