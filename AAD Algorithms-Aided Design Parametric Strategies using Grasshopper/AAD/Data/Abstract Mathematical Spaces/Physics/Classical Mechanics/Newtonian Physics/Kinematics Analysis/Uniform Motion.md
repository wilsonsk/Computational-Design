# Uniform Motion
Uniform motion refers to the motion of an object moving in a **straight line** at a **constant speed**. 

This implies that the object‚Äôs velocity remains constant over time, and there is no acceleration (or deceleration) acting on it. 
	In other words, the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time.
### Characteristics of Uniform Motion
###### Constant Velocity
The speed and direction of the object do not change.
###### Zero Acceleration
Since the velocity is constant, the acceleration is zero.
###### Straight-Line Path
The motion occurs along a straight path without any deviation.
### ### Mathematical Representation of Uniform Motion
In uniform motion, the relationship between displacement (x), velocity (v), and time (t) can be described using simple linear equations.
###### Velocity
The velocity of an object in uniform motion is given by: 
	$\LARGE v=ŒîtŒîx‚Äã$ 
		Where Œîx is the displacement and Œît is the time interval.
###### Displacement
Rearranging the equation for velocity, we can express displacement as: $\LARGE Œîùë•=ùë£‚ãÖŒîùë°$. 

This equation indicates that the displacement (Œîx) is directly proportional to the time interval (Œît) and the constant velocity (v).
### Graphical Representation of Uniform Motion
Uniform motion can be visualized through graphs, which help in understanding the motion more intuitively.
###### Displacement-Time Graph (x-t graph)
In uniform motion, the displacement-time graph is a straight line with a constant slope. The slope of the line represents the velocity of the object. The steeper the slope, the higher the velocity.
###### Velocity-Time Graph (v-t graph)
For uniform motion, the velocity-time graph is a horizontal line parallel to the time axis, indicating constant velocity. There is no change in velocity over time, so the line remains flat.
## Uniform [[Newton's Second Law#Motion|Motion]] in 1D (i.e. 1 Dimension)
Movement along a single axis.
	Because of the 1D motion, vectors are not needed.

Uniformity refers to constant [[#Newton's Second Law Velocity Velocity (v)|velocity]], and constant [[#Displacement (Œîx,Œîy,Œîz)|displacement]].
