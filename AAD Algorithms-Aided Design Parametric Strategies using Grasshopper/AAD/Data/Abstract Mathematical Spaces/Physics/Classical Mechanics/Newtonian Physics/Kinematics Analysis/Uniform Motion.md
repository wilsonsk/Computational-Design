# Uniform Motion
Uniform motion refers to the motion of an object moving in a **straight line** at a **constant speed**. 

It is considered the most simple type of motion.

This implies that the object’s velocity remains constant over time, and there is no acceleration (or deceleration) acting on it. 
	In other words, the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time.
### Characteristics of Uniform Motion
###### Constant [[Newton's Second Law#Velocity|Velocity]]
The speed and direction of the object do not change.
###### Zero [[Newton's Second Law#Acceleration|Acceleration]]
Since the velocity is constant, the acceleration is zero.
###### Straight-Line Path
The motion occurs along a straight path without any deviation.
### Mathematical Representation of Uniform Motion
In uniform motion, the relationship between displacement (x), velocity (v), and time (t) can be described using simple linear equations.
###### Velocity
The velocity of an object in uniform motion is given by: 
	$\LARGE v={Δx \over \triangle t}​ = {x(t_{2}) - x(t_{1}) \over t_{2} - t_{1}}$  
		Where Δx is the displacement and Δt is the time interval.
###### Displacement
Rearranging the equation for velocity, we can express displacement as: $\LARGE Δ𝑥=𝑣⋅Δ𝑡$. 
	Where velocity is scaled by the time interval.
		That is, for each interval of time, there is the velocity magnitude. 

This equation indicates that the displacement (Δx) is directly proportional to the time interval (Δt) and the constant velocity (v).
### Graphical Representation of Uniform Motion
Uniform motion can be visualized through graphs, which help in understanding the motion more intuitively.
###### Displacement-Time Graph (x-t graph)
In uniform motion, the displacement-time graph is a straight line with a constant slope. 

**The [[Slope|slope]] of the line represents the velocity of the object.**
	**The steeper the slope, the higher the velocity.**
###### Velocity-Time Graph (v-t graph)
For uniform motion, the velocity-time graph is a horizontal line parallel to the time axis, indicating constant velocity. 

There is no change in velocity over time, so the line remains flat.
## Uniform 1D  (i.e. 1 Dimensional) [[Newton's Second Law#Motion|Motion]]
Movement along a single axis.
	Because of the 1D motion, vectors are not needed.

Uniformity refers to constant [[Newton's Second Law#Velocity|velocity]], $v$.
	Which itself means constant [[#Displacement (Δx,Δy,Δz)|displacement]], $\triangle x$ (i.e. the distance between two input values).

***Note*: *The slope of the linear time dependence function is the velocity.***
	**In this case, the slope is 1 / 2 and the velocity is a constant 0.5m/s.**
#### Linear Time Dependence
This is the [[Integrals#The Constant of Integration|integral of a constant]] velocity, which is a linear function.
	Where $\LARGE x_{0}$ is the Integration Constant, that is, it is the initial position of x. 
	
Linear time dependence refers to a relationship where one variable changes linearly with respect to time. 
	In kinematics, this concept is often used to describe how displacement ($\triangle x$) changes over time ($\triangle t$) in scenarios of uniform motion.
##### Equation: $x=vt+{x_0}​$ and $\triangle x = v \triangle  t$ 
The equation describes the linear time dependence of displacement in uniform motion. Here’s what each term represents:

- x: The displacement of the object at time 𝑡t.
- v: The constant velocity of the object.
- t: The elapsed time.
- $x_{0}$​: The initial displacement of the object (the position at t=0).
##### Implications of the Equation
1. **Constant Velocity**:
    - The equation assumes that the velocity 𝑣v is constant. This means the object is moving at a uniform speed without any acceleration.
2. **Linear Relationship**:
    - Displacement (𝑥x) is a linear function of time (𝑡t). This implies that as time increases, the displacement changes in a straight-line manner. The slope of this line is equal to the velocity 𝑣v.
3. **Initial Position**:
    - The term 𝑥0x0​ represents the initial position of the object. It is the displacement at the starting time (𝑡=0t=0).
	    - The term 𝑥0x0​ represents the position of the object at the start of the observation (when 𝑡=0t=0). It is not a displacement in the usual sense (as displacement typically refers to a change in position), but rather the starting point from which we measure subsequent displacements.
##### Why Initial Position is Important
- **Reference Point**:
    - The initial position 𝑥0x0​ serves as a reference point for all subsequent measurements of position. Without specifying 𝑥0x0​, we wouldn't know where the object started, making it difficult to describe its motion accurately.
- **Relative Displacement**:
    - The displacement from the initial position can be thought of as how far and in what direction the object has moved from 𝑥0x0​.
