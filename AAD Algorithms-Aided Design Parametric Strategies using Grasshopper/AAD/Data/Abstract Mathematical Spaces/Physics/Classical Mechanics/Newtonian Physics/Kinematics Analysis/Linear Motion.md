# Linear Motion
Linear motion refers to motion along a straight line, but it does not specify whether the speed is constant. 
	Linear motion can involve varying speed, constant speed, or even accelerated motion along a straight path.
## 1D Motion: [[Newton's Second Law#Velocity|Velocity]]
#### Assuming Non-Constant Velocity

### Average Velocity (i.e. Average Rate of Change)
![[Pasted image 20240529123542.png]]
Describes the constant Velocity between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ ***if*** the motion was linear. 
#### $\LARGE \bar{v}={Œîx \over \triangle t}‚Äã = {x(t_{2}) - x(t_{1}) \over t_{2} - t_{1}}$  
*Bar denotes average or mean.*

Notice that the **Average** Velocity is slope of the [[Secant Line|Secant line]].
	The Secant Line being a linear function that connects two points of a function. 
		The Secant Line in this case, is the [[Uniform Motion#Linear Time Dependence|linear time dependence function]], with Average Velocity as its slope.

When we consider two points on the position-time graph, say (t1‚Äã,s(t1‚Äã)) and (t2‚Äã,s(t2‚Äã)), the secant line connecting these two points represents the average rate of change of position with respect to time between t1‚Äã and t2‚Äã. 
	The slope of this secant line is the average velocity $\bar{v}$‚Äã over the interval [ùë°1,ùë°2][t1‚Äã,t2‚Äã]:
		$\bar{v}‚Äã=t2‚Äã‚àít1‚Äãs(t2‚Äã)‚àís(t1‚Äã)‚Äã$

This slope (average velocity) is calculated by taking the difference in position and dividing it by the difference in time between the two points.

### [[Derivatives|Velocity at Time]] $t$ (i.e. Instantaneous Rate of Change)
![[Pasted image 20240529130139.png|300]]
#### $\LARGE v= \lim\limits_{\triangle t \rightarrow 0} {Œîx \over \triangle t}‚Äã = {dx \over dt} = x'(t) = \dot{x}$
*Note: The "dot" above $x$ denotes a derivative with respect to time.*
	"$v = \dot{x}$"

As the [[Kinematics Analysis#Displacement (Œîx,Œîy,Œîz)|displacement]] (i.e. interval between x values) of $\triangle x$ approaches 0, this represents the [[Limits|limit]]  of the secant line which is becomes a tangent line associated with "one" point or value of x (when the interval is 0).
	And the slope of this [[Tangent Line|tangent line]] is the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of the point (i.e. x value in this case). 
		And this derivative is the velocity at that point. 
![[Pasted image 20240529215642.png|300]]
This graph is the velocity ($\LARGE v(t)$) - i.e. the derivative (i.e. $\LARGE x'(t)$ or $\LARGE \dot{x}(t)$)for each point of the graph of the function $\LARGE x(t)$.
	Where each point of this function is the derivative of a t value of function x(t).

#### Example Problem Setup

We have a position function x(t) and we want to find its derivative x‚Ä≤(t), which represents the velocity v(t).
##### Definition of the Derivative
The derivative x‚Ä≤(t) of x(t) is given by the limit:

## 1D Motion: [[Newton's Second Law#Acceleration|Acceleration]]
![[Pasted image 20240531150448.png]]
### Average Acceleration Between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$
![[Pasted image 20240531150433.png|500]]
#### $\LARGE \bar{a} = {v(t_{2}) - v(t_{1}) \over t_{2} - t_{1}} = {\triangle v \over \triangle t}$
### Acceleration at Time $t$
![[Pasted image 20240531140529.png|500]]
#### $\LARGE a(t)= \lim\limits_{\triangle t \rightarrow 0} {Œîv \over \triangle t}‚Äã = {dv \over dt} = \dot{v} = {d^{2}x \over dt^{2}} = x''(t) = \ddot{x}$

I.e. The **derivative**, $a(t)$, *is* the **slope of the tangent line** *which is* the **limit**, $\lim\limits_{\triangle v \rightarrow 0}$  of the **linear function that connects two points** (i.e. the secant line), $\triangle v$, as **the displacement between the points, $\triangle t$, decreases to 0**.
