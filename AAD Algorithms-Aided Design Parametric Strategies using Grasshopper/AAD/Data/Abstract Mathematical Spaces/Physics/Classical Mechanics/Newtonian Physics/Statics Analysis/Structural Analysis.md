# Structural Analysis (i.e. [[Statics Analysis|Static Analysis]] of Structures)
  Structural analysis is a branch of civil engineering that involves the assessment and evaluation of the structural integrity and stability of buildings, bridges, and other structures. 
  
  The primary goal of structural analysis is to ensure that a structure can withstand various loads and forces it is expected to encounter over its service life without failing. 
	  This involves calculating the effects of loads, such as those from weight, wind, seismic activity, and other environmental and human-induced factors.

Structural analysis is not only about ensuring a structure does not fail but also about optimizing structures for cost, efficiency, and material use.
#### Key Aspects of Structural Analysis
###### Load Analysis
Structures must be analyzed for various types of loads they will experience. These include dead loads (the weight of the structure itself), live loads (weight of the users and movable objects), environmental loads (such as wind and snow), and dynamic loads (including impacts and vibrations).
###### Stress and Strain Calculations
The analysis involves determining the stresses (forces per unit area) and strains (deformations in a body) that occur in different components of a structure under load. The aim is to ensure that these stresses and strains do not exceed the material strengths.
###### Factor of Safety
Structures are designed with a factor of safety, which is a margin of error that accounts for uncertainties in the load assumptions, material properties, and structural behavior.
###### Behavior Under Loads
Understanding how a structure behaves under expected loads is crucial. This includes analyzing deflections (how much a structure bends or displaces), rotations, and potential buckling (sudden failure due to compressive forces).
###### Methods and Tools
Modern structural analysis often utilizes software and computational tools that employ methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM), which allows detailed simulations of how structures respond to loads.
Traditional methods such as the Method of Joints, Method of Sections, and Matrix methods are still fundamental and are used to calculate internal forces and moments manually or semi-automatically.
###### Design Compliance and Safety Codes
Structural analysis ensures that designs comply with local and international building codes and safety standards, which dictate minimum requirements for safety, stability, and durability.
