# Topology (i.e. relational structure)
The way in which constituent parts are interrelated or arranged. 
Studies surfaces and other global properties from an abstract point of view.Â It's considered to be one of the most basic forms of geometry and is used in many areas of mathematics.

## Truss
An assembly of members such as beams (i.e. edges), connected by **nodes**, that creates a rigid structure.

In engineering, a truss is a structure that "consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object"
