# Scientific Method
Science is the process of _describing_ the world around us. 

It is important to note that describing the world around us is not the same as _explaining_ the world around us. 

Science aims to **answer the question “How?”** 
	**And not the question “Why?"**. 
	
As we develop our description of the physical world, you should remember this important distinction and resist the urge to ask “Why?"

The Scientific Method is a prescription for coming up with a description of the physical world that anyone can challenge and improve through performing experiments.
	If we come up with a description that can describe many observations, or the outcome of many different experiments, then we usually call that description a “Scientific Theory”.

## Applying the Scientific Method (A Very Loose and General Prescription)
1. **Identify and Describe a New Process**: Start by identifying a process that is not yet explained by an existing theory and describe it in detail.
2. **Examine Similar Processes**: Investigate similar processes to see if they can be described similarly, offering insights that might apply to the new process.
3. **Develop a Theory**: Refine the description into a theory that can generalize and predict outcomes across various scenarios.
4. **Test the Predictions**: Conduct experiments to test the predictions derived from the theory on new processes, observing if the predictions hold true.
5. **Refine the Theory**: Continuously improve the theory based on experimental results, especially when predictions fail.
## Theory
A theory is a set of statements or an equation providing a broad description applicable to multiple phenomena.
	It allows for verifiable predictions and offers a cohesive framework for understanding various observations.
## Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a specific, testable consequence derived from a theory. It represents a focused prediction that can be experimentally verified or falsified.
## Model 
A model is a detailed, situation-specific description of a phenomenon, based on a theory, used to make precise predictions. 
	It bridges the gap between the theoretical framework and practical observations, allowing for targeted experimentation and validation.
