# Measurement
Measurement is the process of quantitatively comparing an unknown quantity to a standard unit. 

This process involves assigning a numerical value to the quantity of interest, allowing for accurate and reproducible comparisons.

Measurement is fundamental in science, engineering, and daily life, providing a basis for understanding, describing, and manipulating physical phenomena.
## Units of Measurement
A unit is a standardized quantity used to express measurements. 
	Common units include meters for length, kilograms for mass, and seconds for time. Units ensure that measurements are consistent and understandable universally.
### Accuracy and Precision
High-quality measurements strive for both accuracy and precision.
###### Accuracy
Refers to how close a measured value is to the true value.
###### Precision
Indicates how reproducible measurements are when repeated under the same conditions. 

## Dimensions
“Dimensions” can be thought of as types of measurements.

*For example*, length and time are both dimensions.

A unit is the standard that we choose to quantify a dimension.
	*For example*, meters and feet are both units for the **dimension** of length, whereas seconds are **units** for the dimension of time.

###### SI Units
In order to facilitate communication of scientific information, the International System of units (SI for the french, Systeme International d’unites) was developed. 
	This allows us to use a well-defined convention for which units to use when describing quantities.

| **Dimension**           | **SI Unit**   |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Length [L][𝐿]          | meter [m]     |
| Time [T]                | second [s]    |
| Mass [M]                | kilogram [kg] |
| Temperature [θ]         | kelvin [K]    |
| Electric Current [I]    | ampere [A]    |
| Amount of Substance [N] | mole [mol]    |
| Luminous Intensity [J]  | candela [cd]  |
| Dimensionless [l]       | unitless []   |
##### Derived Dimensions
From the base dimensions, one can obtain “derived” dimensions such as “speed” which is a measure of how fast an object is moving. 
	The dimension of speed is $L/T$ (length over time) and the corresponding SI unit is $m/s^2$.

| **Dimension**          | **SI unit**            | **SI base units**   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Speed [L/T]            | meter per second [m/s] | [m/s]               |
| Frequency [1/T]        | hertz [Hz]             | [1/s]               |
| Force [M⋅L⋅T−2]        | newton [N]             | [kg⋅m⋅s−2]          |
| Energy [M⋅L2⋅T−2]      | joule [J]              | [N⋅m=kg⋅m2⋅s−2]     |
| Power [M⋅L2⋅T−3]       | watt [W]               | [J/s=kg⋅m2⋅s−3]     |
| Electric Charge [I⋅T]  | coulomb [C]            | [A⋅s]               |
| Voltage [M⋅L2⋅T−3⋅I−1] | volt [V]               | [J/C=kg⋅m2⋅s−3⋅A−1] |
## Orders of Magnitude 
The order of magnitude of a quantity is the scale or size of that quantity in powers of ten. 

When we say that a prediction gives the right "order of magnitude," we usually mean that the prediction is within a factor of "a few" (up to a factor of 10) of the correct value.
