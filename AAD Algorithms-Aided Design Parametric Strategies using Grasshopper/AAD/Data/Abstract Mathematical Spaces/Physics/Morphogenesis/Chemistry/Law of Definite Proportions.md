# Law of Definite Proportions
The law states that a chemical compound always contains the same proportion of elements by mass.
	This law indicates that the masses of the elements in a compound are [[Division#Division as a Proportional Relationship (i.e. Direct Proportionality)|directly proportional]] to each other.

If the masses of two elements in a compound are denoted as $A$ and $B$.
	According to the law of definite proportions:
	$$\LARGE \frac{A}{B} = k$$
		Where $k$ is the [[Division#Constant Ratio of Proportional Relationship/Direct Proportionality|constant of proportionality]].
#### Proportional Reasoning of the Law of Definite Proportions
The fixed ratio $\LARGE \frac{A}{B} = k$ tells us that for every unit mass of element $B$, there is a constant multiple K of element $A$.
	If you double the mass of $B$, the mass of $A$ also doubles, maintaining the ratio $k$.
#### Example
Consider water (Hâ‚‚O)
	The mass of hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) in water are always in the ratio 1:8.
		If $A$ is the mass of hydrogen and $B$ is the mass of oxygen, then:
$$\LARGE \frac{A}{B} = \frac{1}{8}$$
			This means $k = \frac{1}{8}$, the constant of proportionality.
