# Law of Multiple Proportions
*The ratio of a ratio.*

The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements combine to form more than one compound, the ratios of the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element are simple whole numbers (i.e. whole number [[Division#Constant of Direct Proportionality is a Constant Ratio ($ LARGE k$)|constants of proportionality]]).

The fixed ratio is the constant of proportionality, showing how the masses of elements relate directly in a single compound (definite proportions) or across multiple compounds (multiple proportions). 
	These laws provide a consistent framework for understanding how elements combine in fixed and multiple ratios, ensuring predictable and consistent chemical behavior.
		The concept of direct proportionality and the constant of proportionality ($k$) underpin these fixed and multiple ratios, facilitating proportional reasoning in chemistry.
			Understanding these relationships through direct proportionality and proportional reasoning helps to grasp the consistent and predictable nature of chemical compounds.
#### Mathematical Context of Direct Proportionality
If the masses of one element in two different compounds are denoted as $A_1$ and $A_2$, and let $B$ be the fixed mass of the other element.
	According to the law of multiple proportions:
  $$\LARGE \frac{A_1}{B} = k_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{A_2}{B} = k_2$$
		  where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are constants of proportionality, and $k_2$ is a whole number direct proportion of $k_1$.
  $$\LARGE k_2 = k_{k_1k_2}k_1$$
### Proportional Reasoning
If element A combines with a fixed mass of element B to form different compounds, the ratios of the masses of A in these compounds will be simple whole number multiples of each other.
	In multiple proportions, different compounds show simple whole number multiples of these ratios, reflecting direct proportional relationships between the elements in different compounds.

The ratios $\LARGE \frac{A_1}{B}$ and $\LARGE \frac{A_2}{B}$ are in simple whole number multiples.
	This means that if $\LARGE A_1 = k_1 \cdot B$ and $\LARGE A_2 = k_2 \cdot B$, then $k_2$ is a simple multiple of $k_1$ (e.g., $k_2 = 2k_1$).
#### Example
Consider carbon and oxygen forming carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂):
##### Carbon Monoxide (CO)
In CO, the ratio of the mass of oxygen to carbon might be approximately 1.33:1.
$$\LARGE  \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{mass of oxygen in CO}}{\text{mass of carbon}} = k_1$$
	
##### In Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
In CO₂, the ratio of the mass of oxygen to carbon is approximately 2.66:1.
$$\LARGE \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{mass of oxygen in CO₂}}{\text{mass of carbon}} = k_2$$

Here, $\frac{2.66}{1.33} = 2$, indicating that the ratio in CO₂ is twice that in CO, showing simple whole number multiple.
##### Direct Proportionality of $CO_2$ to $CO$
According to the law of multiple proportions, $k_2$ is a whole number multiple of $k_1$.
	If $k_1 = 1.33$ and $k_2 = 2.66$, then:
$$\LARGE k_2 = 2k_1 \quad (\text{since 2.66 is twice 1.33})$$
