# Quantum Mechanics

## The [[Dynamics Analysis#The Abstract, Non-Physical Abstract Mathematical Objects Abstract, Non-Physical Environments Environment|Abstract Mathematical Space]] of Quantum Mechanics
The abstract mathematical environment of quantum mechanics is designed to address the unique challenges and phenomena observed at microscopic scales, such as superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty. 

These concepts are fundamentally different from those in classical physics, requiring a distinct and sophisticated mathematical framework for their description and analysis. 

This environment not only encapsulates the mathematical structures needed for this description but also provides the theoretical basis for advances in technology and our understanding of the universe at the quantum level.
### Characteristics of the The Abstract, Non-Physical Environment
#### Probabilistic and Statistical: 
Unlike the deterministic environment of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics inherently involves probabilities, where the outcomes of measurements are not predetermined but have probabilities described by the wave function or density matrix.
#### Complex and Non-Local: 
Quantum mechanics allows for phenomena like entanglement, where particles remain connected across vast distances, affecting each other’s states instantaneously.
#### Wave-Particle Duality: 
This principle is embedded in the mathematical structure, allowing entities to be described both as particles and waves.
### Components of the Abstract Quantum Environment
###### Hilbert Spaces:
Quantum mechanics fundamentally utilizes Hilbert spaces to describe the states of quantum systems. These are complete vector spaces equipped with an inner product, which allows for the definition of orthogonality and norm, crucial for describing quantum states. Hilbert spaces can handle infinite dimensions, accommodating the complex wave functions that describe particles in quantum theory.
###### Operators and Observables:
In this environment, physical quantities such as momentum, position, and energy are represented by operators, which are mathematical functions acting on the Hilbert spaces. These operators are essential for extracting measurable properties from the state vectors (wave functions) and are defined to adhere to the specific rules of quantum mechanics, including non-commutativity which leads to fundamental quantum phenomena like the uncertainty principle.
###### Wave Functions:
The wave function, typically denoted as ψ, is a complex function that provides the probability amplitudes for the quantum states of particles. The square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density of finding particles in various positions or states, serving as the primary descriptor of a quantum system's state.
###### Schrödinger Equation:
This is the fundamental equation of motion in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It involves the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of the system, linking the time evolution of quantum states to the energy properties of the system.
###### Quantum Field Theory (QFT):
For environments dealing with fields and particles at high energies or in relativistic contexts, Quantum Field Theory extends the principles of quantum mechanics. It treats particles as excited states of underlying fields, described mathematically by field operators acting on quantum states in a Hilbert space.
###### Density Matrices:
In scenarios involving mixed states or when a state is not fully known, density matrices are used. These are operators on Hilbert spaces that provide a statistical description of a mixed quantum state, generalizing the concept of a wave function to encompass ensembles of states.
###### Spin and Pauli Matrices:
Quantum mechanics also fundamentally involves the concept of spin, an intrinsic form of angular momentum that does not have a classical analog. Spin is described using spinors and represented by Pauli matrices in the case of spin-½ particles, which are crucial for describing the properties of fermions like electrons.
## The Fundamental [[Dynamics Analysis#The Abstract Mathematical Objects that Model the Subject Under Study|Abstract Mathematical Objects]] in Quantum Mechanics:
######  Wavefunction:
The wavefunction (usually denoted as ψ) is one of the most central concepts in quantum mechanics. It provides a complete description of the quantum state of a particle or a system of particles. The wavefunction is a complex-valued function of space and time, and its absolute square (|ψ|^2) represents the probability density of finding particles at a particular location when a measurement is made.
###### Operators:
In quantum mechanics, physical observables such as momentum, position, and energy are represented by operators. These operators act on wavefunctions and are fundamental in the formulation of quantum theories. For instance, the Hamiltonian operator corresponds to the total energy of the system and is crucial in determining how the state of a system evolves over time according to the Schrödinger equation.
###### Spinors:
For particles with spin, spinors are used as mathematical objects to describe their quantum states. Spinors are elements of a complex vector space, which encapsulate information about the orientation of a particle's spin and its intrinsic angular momentum.
###### Qubits:
In the context of quantum information theory, the qubit is a fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to the bit in classical information theory. A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, where the states are represented by vectors in a two-dimensional Hilbert space.
## [[Dynamics Analysis#Scale|Scale]]
### Components of Quantum Scale
###### Physical Size and Scope:
At the quantum scale, we deal with atomic and subatomic particles—electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons. The spatial dimensions are typically on the order of angstroms (10^-10 meters) and smaller, down to the scale of elementary particles measured in femtometers (10^-15 meters).
###### Energy Levels:
Energy scales are crucial in quantum mechanics, especially because the energy of quantum phenomena often determines the interactions and the type of quantum systems studied. This includes energy levels from a few electron volts in atomic physics to giga-electron volts in high-energy particle physics.
###### Time Scales:
Quantum processes can occur over extremely short time scales, often in the range of femtoseconds (10^-15 seconds) or even shorter for high-energy processes. These rapid changes require time-dependent quantum mechanical treatments like the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
###### Measurement and Interaction:
Scale in quantum mechanics also involves the precision and nature of measurements. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle fundamentally limits the precision with which position and momentum, or energy and time, can be simultaneously known. The scale of measurement precision directly impacts the theoretical and experimental approach to quantum systems.
## [[Dynamics Analysis#State|States]]
Quantum states are abstract mathematical representations of the properties of quantum systems, providing the foundational language through which quantum phenomena are described and predicted. 

Understanding quantum states involves appreciating how they are measured, how they evolve, and how they interact with other states and with measurement apparatuses, all within the probabilistic and often counterintuitive framework of quantum mechanics. 

This understanding is crucial for navigating the quantum world, from fundamental physics to practical applications like quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
#### Measurement and Change in Quantum States
###### Quantum Measurement:
The process of measurement in quantum mechanics is unique in that it causes the quantum state to 'collapse' to one of the eigenstates of the observable being measured. The probability of the system collapsing to a particular eigenstate is determined by the state vector or wave function prior to measurement.
###### Time Evolution:
The evolution of quantum states over time is governed by the Schrödinger equation for wave functions or by the more general unitary evolution in the case of state vectors in Hilbert space. The Hamiltonian of the system (the operator corresponding to the total energy) plays a crucial role in determining how quantum states evolve.
###### Entanglement:
Quantum states can exhibit entanglement, where the state of one particle becomes dependent on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This non-local property challenges many classical intuitions about the separability and independence of states.
## [[Dynamics Analysis#Change|Change]]
In quantum mechanics, the notion of motion differs significantly due to the fundamental principles of the theory, which includes the dual wave-particle nature of matter, uncertainty principle, and superposition. 

Here, motion does not necessarily refer to a particle moving along a well-defined path.
	Instead, it involves changes in the quantum state of a system, which can be described by:
###### Wavefunction Evolution:
The change of the wavefunction over time, according to the Schrödinger equation, dictates the behavior of quantum systems. This evolution governs how the probabilities of finding particles in various positions or states change.
###### Probability Currents: 
Rather than describing motion as a path from point A to point B, quantum mechanics often talks about the flow of probability, which can be analogous to motion.
## [[Dynamics Analysis#Kinematics Identifying the "Present" (i.e. initial) State State (of condition, Parameters parameters ).|Kinematics]]
At the quantum scale, particles do not adhere to classical intuitive paths or trajectories. 
	Instead, their behavior is described by a set of different parameters that reflect the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics:	
###### Wavefunction (𝜓ψ): 
The fundamental descriptor of a quantum state, representing the amplitude of the probability density function of finding particles like electrons in a particular space and time. The square of the absolute value of the wavefunction, ∣𝜓∣2∣ψ∣2, gives the probability density of the particle’s position.
###### Probability Density:
Used instead of definite positions, it provides the likelihood of finding a particle within a particular region of space at a given time.
###### Operators:
Mathematical operations that are applied to wavefunctions to obtain observable quantities (like position, momentum). These are integral in defining measurements in quantum mechanics.    
###### Commutation Relations:
These define how certain pairs of observables, such as position and momentum, interact and impose fundamental limits on their simultaneous measurability (illustrated by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle).
###### Quantum Numbers: 
Sets of discrete values that describe properties like the energy levels of electrons in atoms, angular momentum, spin, etc. These numbers are derived from the solutions to the Schrödinger equation for quantum systems.
###### Entanglement and Superposition:
Conditions that describe relationships between particles where they share correlated quantum states
## [[Dynamics Analysis#Dynamics "Explains" the Causality of a State Change|Dynamics]]
###### Probabilistic over Deterministic
Fundamentally [[Probable Reality|probabilistic]], dealing with likelihoods and uncertainties.
	Where initial conditions **do not** clearly, objectively cause (i.e. do not determine) future states.
		I.e. No objective causality at this scale.

Where every future state exists within a probability distribution, and thus, is a random draw/sampling a noisy signal, where initial conditions influence probability but do not determine a future state.
###### A Model of Interactions over "Forces"
The fundamental interactions are described by quantum field theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where fields rather than forces are the primary focus, and particle interactions are described by exchange particles like photons and gluons.
###### Quantum (i.e. micro) Forces
At the quantum level, forces are understood as interactions mediated by gauge bosons (e.g., photons for electromagnetic force).
