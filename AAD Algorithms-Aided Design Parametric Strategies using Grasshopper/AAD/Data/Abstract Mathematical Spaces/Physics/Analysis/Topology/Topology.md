# Topology (i.e. relational structure)
The way in which constituent parts are interrelated or arranged. 


## Truss
An assembly of members such as beams (i.e. edges), connected by **nodes**, that creates a rigid structure.

In engineering, a truss is a structure that "consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object"
