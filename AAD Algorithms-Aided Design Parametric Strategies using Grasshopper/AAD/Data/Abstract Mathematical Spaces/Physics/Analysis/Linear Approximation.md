# Linear Approximation
Linear approximation refers to the process of approximating a nonlinear (curved) geometry by a linear object, such as a line or a plane, at a specific point. 
	This is done by using the [[Tangent Space|tangent space]].

Together they provide a way to simplify and locally analyze complex curved geometries, making it easier to design, optimize, and understand architectural forms and structures. 
	By approximating nonlinear shapes with linear ones at specific points, we gain valuable insights and practical solutions for real-world applications.

## How Linear Approximation Works
#### 1. Using the Tangent Line for Curves:
For a curve, the tangent line at a point provides a straight-line approximation of the curve's behavior near that point. 
	If you zoom in close enough to the point of tangency, the curve and the tangent line look almost identical.
#### 2. Using the Tangent Plane for Surfaces:
For a surface, the tangent plane at a point provides a flat-plane approximation of the surface's behavior near that point. 
	This plane "touches" the surface exactly at that point and aligns with the surface's slope at that point.
