# Partial Derivatives
Derivatives in 2D and 3D (and higher dimensions) are generally referred to as **partial derivatives** when dealing with functions of multiple variables. 

For a function of multiple variables, such as $f(x,y)$ or $f(x,y,z)$:
	Partial derivatives represent the rate of change of the function with respect to one of its variables, while holding the other variables constant.
