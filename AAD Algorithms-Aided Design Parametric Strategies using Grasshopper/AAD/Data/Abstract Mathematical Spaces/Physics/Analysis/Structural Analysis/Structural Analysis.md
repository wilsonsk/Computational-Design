# Structural Analysis
## Vector Addition
Forces are vectors, which means they have both magnitude and direction. 
	When multiple forces act on a single point or body, they must be combined according to vector addition to find the net force.

In vector addition, each vector is broken down into its **component scalars** (i.e. component "vectors" - that is the result of scaled unit vectors) along the x and y axes.
	The components along the same axis are added together to get the net force components in each direction.

In a two-dimensional setting:
- The x-components of all forces are added together to get the net force in the x-direction ($F_{net,x}$​).
- The y-components of all forces are added together to get the net force in the y-direction ($F_{net,y}$​).
###### Equilibrium
For a system to be in equilibrium, the net force in both the x and y directions must be zero. 
	Mathematically, this is written as: $ΣF_x​=0$ and $ΣF_y​=0$
		It's the principle of superposition that allows this vector addition to work: the effect of the individual forces can be added together to get the total effect. 
			In equilibrium problems, this principle is used to ensure that all forces balance out, resulting in no net motion of the object in question.

Trigonometry is essential for breaking down the forces into their x and y components when they're acting at an angle. 
	For a force vector at an angle β from the vertical, the trigonometric functions ($sin$) and ($cos$) are used to find the magnitudes of the components:
		- The x-component (horizontal) of the force is found by multiplying the force's magnitude by the sine of the angle: $F⋅sin(β)$.
		- The y-component (vertical) of the force is found by multiplying the force's magnitude by the cosine of the angle: $F⋅cos(β)$.

This breakdown allows you to add up all the horizontal components separately from all the vertical components, which is exactly what you do when you're solving for equilibrium.
	When the sum of the x-components and the sum of the y-components both equal zero, the object is in a state of equilibrium—it won't accelerate in any direction because the net force acting on it is zero.
