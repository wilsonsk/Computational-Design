# Slope
The slope of a linear function is a scalar that describes the rate at which the dependent variable changes with respect to the independent variable.
	I.e. It is a scalar that quantifies the rate of change of the function with respect to its independent variable. Let's explore this concept in detail.

##### Difference Quotient
The ratio of the change in output values to the change in the input values).
	This ratio is the slope of a linear function.
		Aka the Slope of the Secant Line.
#### $\LARGE {f(x+h)−f(x)​ \over h}$
