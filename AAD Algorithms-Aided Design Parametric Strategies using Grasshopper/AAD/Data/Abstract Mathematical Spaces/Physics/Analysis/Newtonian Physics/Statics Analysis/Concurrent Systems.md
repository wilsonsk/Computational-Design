# Concurrent Force Systems
A set of [[Statics Analysis#Structural Analysis Static Equilibrium Point Forces Point Forces as Vectors|point forces]] is considered concurrent if all the [[Statics Analysis#Line of Action|lines of action]] of those forces all come together at a single point.
	I.e. A concurrent force system is one where all forces acting on a body intersect at a common point, regardless of their directions.

Because the forces all act through a single point, **there are no [[Non-Concurrent Systems#Moments (i.e. Torque)|moments]] about this point**.
	Because no moments exist, we can treat this body as a¬†**particle**. 
		In fact, because real particles only exist in theory, most particle analysis is actually applied to extended bodies with concurrent forces acting on them.

## General Static Equilibrium Analysis for Concurrent Force Systems
If a body is in static equilibrium, then by definition that body is not accelerating (i.e. velocity is not changing- and therefore doesn't need to be "not moving"). 
	If we know that the body is not accelerating then we know that¬†**the sum of the forces acting on that body must be equal to zero**. 
		This is the basis of Concurrent Force equilibrium analysis (I.e. Translational Equilibrium) of a body. 
		
In order to solve for any unknowns in the sum of forces equation, turn the one vector equation into a set of scalar equations. 
	For two dimensional problems, split our one vector equation down into two scalar equations. 
		We do this by summing up all the¬†$x$¬†components of the force vectors and setting them equal to zero in our first equation.
			Then summing up all the¬†$y$¬†components of the force vectors and setting them equal to zero in our second equation.
	For three dimensional problems, add a third equation.
		The sum of all our¬†$z$¬†components equal to zero.

 $\LARGE \sum{\vec{F_y}}‚Äã=0$
 $\LARGE \sum{F_x}‚Äã=0$ ; $\LARGE \sum{F_y}‚Äã=0$ ; $\LARGE \sum{F_z}‚Äã=0$
## [[Concurrent Systems|Translational Equilibrium]] in Concurrent Systems
Translational equilibrium is focused entirely on the linear aspects of motion, not addressing any rotational dynamics that might be present.
	$\begin{equation*} \LARGE \sum \vec{F} = m \times \vec{a} \end{equation*}$

**In a concurrent system**, translational equilibrium occurs when the vector sum of all forces acting on the [[Bodies|body]] equals zero ($‚àëF=0$).
	Applies to both [[Bodies#Particles|particles]] and [[Bodies#Rigid Bodies|rigid bodies]]. 
		All external forces must sum to zero, ensuring no net force acts on the object, thus preventing any translational motion or acceleration.
			I.e. There is no net acceleration and the body will either remain at rest or move with constant velocity.
				Therefore, $\large a=0$

Translational equilibrium specifically refers to the condition where the sum of all external forces acting on a body is zero, indicating no net force. 
	This implies that there is no net linear acceleration, meaning the body is either stationary or moving with a constant velocity (not changing speed or direction). 
### Calculating the Vector Sum of Forces
Each force is resolved into its component vectors along established axes (typically, x, y, and z axes in three-dimensional systems). 
	This involves decomposing each force into its horizontal and vertical components, using trigonometry based on the angle the force makes with the reference axes.
### The General Procedure for Finding the Equilibrium Equations
##### 1. Draw [[Free Body Diagram|Free Body Diagrams]]
###### Identify the Point of Concurrency (i.e. System Component Isolation)
Draw a [[Free Body Diagram|free body diagram]] of each body or point of concurrency being analyzed to determine the common point through which all the forces act - this is the **point of concurrency**.
	In the context of concurrent systems, where multiple forces meet at certain points, **each component or point of the system that experiences different forces** should **have its own Free Body Diagram (FBD)**.

Each part of the system (e.g., individual springs, the weight) is considered separately to analyze the forces and moments acting on it.
###### 1. **Individual Components or Objects**
Each distinct physical object or component in the system that has forces acting on it should have its own FBD.
- Also called the "body of interest".
	- **Example**: The block or mass in a spring system.
		Weight (Mass):
		- **Load or Object FBD**: The free body diagram for the mass (or weight) (for example hanging from the springs).
			- Shows the forces acting on the weight, including the gravitational force (weight) and the tension forces from the springs.
###### 2. Springs Connected at Junction
- **Spring FBD**: The free body diagram for the individual springs.
	- Shows the forces acting on each spring, including the tension forces at the points where they connect to the weight and to the supports.
	- Each spring is isolated to show the forces acting on it.
	- Displays the tension forces at the points where the spring connects to other parts of the system (e.g., the weight and the junction points).
###### 3. Junction or Connection Point
- **Junction FBD**: The free body diagram for the point where the springs are connected (e.g., point A).
	- Shows the forces acting on the junction from each of the springs and any external forces.
	- Sometimes referred to as "nodes" in structural analysis.
	- The point where multiple springs or forces converge.
	- Shows the forces acting at the junction from each of the springs and any other external forces.
###### 4. Forces and Moments at Each Point
The forces and moments acting at each specific location where different components are connected or where external forces are applied.
    - **Example**: Forces exerted by springs at the connection point.

The diagram should show all the known and unknown force vectors acting externally on the body.
- In the free body diagram, provide values for any of the know magnitudes or directions for the force vectors and provide variable names for any unknowns (either magnitudes or directions).
	![[Pasted image 20240504003640.png]]
##### 2. Chose the $x, y, z$ Axes
These axes must be perpendicular to one another, but do not need to necessarily have to be horizontal or vertical. 
##### 3. [[Static Equilibrium#Decomposing Forces|Decomposition]]
Break down all of the force vectors into [[Static Equilibrium#Vector Form Analysis (i.e. Cartesian Vectors)|component scaled unit vectors]] along the $x, y, x$ directions. 
	If forces are given in vector form or applied at angles to a coordinate system, resolve each force into its orthogonal components (typically along x, y, and possibly z axes in three-dimensional space).
- The first equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the¬†$ùë•$¬†direction being equal to zero.
- The second equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the¬†$y$¬†direction being equal to zero.
- And the third (if a 3D problem) will be the sum of the magnitudes in the¬†$z$ $direction being equal to zero.
- Collectively these are known as the¬†**equilibrium equations**.
##### 4. Sum up the Force Components
Solve the unknowns using algebra. 
	- The number of unknowns that you will be able to solve for will be the number of equilibrium equations that you have.
	- In instances where you have more unknowns than equations, the problem is known as a¬†**statically indeterminate problem**¬†and you will need additional information to solve for the given unknowns.
### [[Bodies#Particles in Static Equilibrium Translational Equilibrium Translational Equilibrium in Concurrent Systems|Particle Translational Equilibrium in Concurrent Systems]]
A [[Bodies#Particles in Static Equilibrium Translational Equilibrium Translational Equilibrium in Concurrent Systems|particle in Translational Equilibrium]] is said to be in equilibrium if it is at rest (and has been at rest) or is in motion with a constant velocity (i.e. no acceleration). 

To analyze equilibrium particles, [[Free Body Diagram|Free Body Diagrams]] are drawn to show all forces acting on the particle. 

Commonly found systems in these Free Body Diagrams of particles are:
#### Particle Spring Systems
![[Pasted image 20240519142716.png]]
The force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position according to [[Form-Finding Strategies Using Kangaroo#Hooke's Law|Hooke's Law]]: $\LARGE F=kŒîx$.
	With a spring length that changes in proportion to the force acting on it. 
###### Variable Magnitude of the Force Along a Spring
The magnitude of a force along a spring can change depending on the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. This is a key characteristic of spring forces described by [[Form-Finding Strategies Using Kangaroo#Hooke's Law|Hooke's Law]].
	As the displacement ($\large Œîx$) changes, the magnitude of the force ($|\vec{F}|$) changes proportionally.
		This means that as the spring stretches or compresses, the displacement ($Œîx$) changes, which **means the force magnitude changes, thus the force exerted by the spring is not constant**.
			It **varies as the spring stretches or compresses**.
###### Variable Component Vectors of Force Vectors Along a Spring
And therefore, the **component vectors of the Force Vectors** change as well.
	I.e. As the spring extends (i.e. as the displacement ($Œîx$) changes), the x and y components can change (relative to their [[Form-Finding Strategies Using Kangaroo#Rest Length|rest lengths]]) because the overall displacement and hence the force changes.

#### Cables/Pulleys
![[Pasted image 20240519142913.png]]
In a simple pulley system, the tension force along the cable is typically the same on both sides of the pulley.
	This is because the pulley is assumed to be ideal (frictionless and massless), which means it does not affect the tension in the cable.
		 The tension force (denoted as "T") is the same throughout the entire length of the cable, maintaining equilibrium.

Assume:
- Negligible weight.
- No stretch.
- Only support [[Curvature's Role in Stress Distribution#Tension (i.e. stretching stress)|tension]].
##### Properties and Characteristics
1. **Tension in the Cable:**
    - In an ideal cable (massless and inextensible), **the tension is constant throughout its length**.
    - This tension transmits forces from one particle to another through the pulley system.
2. **Pulley Characteristics:**
    - Ideal pulleys are frictionless and massless, meaning they do not add any additional forces or moments to the system.
    - They change the direction of the tension force without altering its magnitude.
3. **Equilibrium Conditions:**
    - The system is in static equilibrium if the sum of forces and moments on each particle is zero.
    - For a particle in equilibrium, the vector sum of all forces acting on it (including tension, gravity, and any applied forces) must be zero.
4. **Force Analysis:**
    - Each particle connected by the cable must be analyzed separately, taking into account all the forces acting on it.
    - Newton's First Law (Œ£F = 0) is used to write equilibrium equations for each particle.
5. **Pulley Systems:**
    - In a single-pulley system, the tension force remains constant in the cable.
    - In a multiple-pulley system (compound pulley), mechanical advantage can be gained, changing the force distribution, but the tension remains consistent along the same segment of cable between pulleys.
##### Steps to Analyze a Particle Cable/Pulley System
1. **Identify All Forces:**
    - Draw a free-body diagram for each particle.
    - Identify and label all forces, including tension, weight (mg), normal forces, and any applied forces.
2. **Establish Coordinate System:**
    - Choose a convenient coordinate system for each particle to resolve forces into components.
3. **Apply Equilibrium Equations:**
    - For each particle, set up the equilibrium equations for forces in the x and y directions:
        ‚àëFx‚Äã=0
        
        ‚àëFy‚Äã=0
        
4. **Relate Tensions Through Pulleys:**
    - Use the property that tension is constant in an ideal cable to relate forces acting through pulleys.
    - In systems with multiple pulleys, consider how the tension in one segment of the cable relates to another.
5. **Solve the System of Equations:**
    - Solve the resulting system of linear equations to find the unknown forces and tensions.
#### Contact Forces
A contact force is any force that occurs as a result of two objects making contact with each other.

##### Types of Contact Forces in Concurrent Particle Systems
###### [[Free Body Diagram#Normal Forces (i.e. Reaction Forces)|Normal Force]]
![[Pasted image 20240519143551.png]]
Is a type contact force that's **perpendicular/orthogonal** to the surface that an object is in contact with. 
###### [[Free Body Diagram#Friction Forces|Friction Force]]
Is a type of contact force that occurs when two surfaces are in contact and moving or sliding against each other.
	Vs [[Curvature's Role in Stress Distribution#Shear Stress|Shearing Force]]
		Friction is a resistance force that occurs when two surfaces rub against each other.¬†
			Shear is a force that occurs when two misaligned forces push different parts of an object in opposite directions
###### [[Free Body Diagram#Tension Forces|Tension Force]]
Is a type of contact force that involves the pulling or stretching force transmitted axially along an object such as a string, rope, chain, rod, truss member, or other object, so as to stretch or pull apart the object.
	In terms of force, it is the opposite of compression.
### Example: Translational Equilibrium in 2D Concurrent [[#Particle Spring Systems|Particle Spring Systems]]
*Note: this problem is different than that problems from [[Static Equilibrium#Force Directed Along a Line (i.e. an example of the position vector method)|previous problems]] where the coordinates or dimensions were used as the [[Static Equilibrium#Vector Form Analysis (i.e. Cartesian Vectors)|components]] of the [[Statics Analysis#Force Vector Representation|Force Vector]].*
	*This is a **SPRING** system, compared to a force within or along a line or cable.*
	*In this new example problem, the dimensions can still be used to find the angle (via tangent function) of the force vectors, but they **can not** be used as **component vectors**.*
		*[[#Springs#Variable Component Vectors of Force Vectors Along a Spring|Remember]], the springs themselves can be compressed or stretched.* 
			*Because the springs are [[Form-Finding Strategies Using Kangaroo#Extensibility|extendible]], the [[#Variable Magnitude of the Force Along a Spring|magnitude of the Force Vectors are variable]].*
				*Therefore, the dimensions are not the components because depending on the magnitude of the force along the spring, the x and y component vectors can differ from their starting dimensions- i.e. their [[Form-Finding Strategies Using Kangaroo#Rest Length|rest lengths]].*
 
![[Pasted image 20240521130100.png|500]]
*Note* this problem asks for the "stretch" of the springs- not the spring force (i.e. the magnitude of the spring Force Vectors).
	"Stretch" refers to the "s" or "x" - the [[#Springs|displacement of the spring]].
#### Steps
1. Create a [[#1. Draw Free Body Diagram Free Body Diagrams|Free Body Diagram]] for each component or point of the system that experiences different forces.
	1. The $y$ components of the Force Vector:
		![[Pasted image 20240521132457.png]]
	2. The $x$ components of the Force Vector:
		![[Pasted image 20240521133017.png|400]]
2. Find the Equilibrium Equations
	1. Decompose the Force Vectors as Means to Find the Spring Force Vector Magnitudes
		As further means to derive the "stretch" values for each spring Force Vector. 
		1. The $y$ components of the Force Vector:
			Which contain the "mass or weight" of the [[#1. **Individual Components or Objects**|body of interest]]
			![[Pasted image 20240521132641.png]]
		2. The $x$ components of the Force Vector:
			In this case the angles are not given.
				Therefore we can use the tangent function to extract the angle given the dimensions of the rest lengths of force vectors' components. 
					![[Pasted image 20240521133118.png]]
				Once the angle is acquired, we can then use the angle to find the $x$ components - as they lie adjacent to the Force Vector.
					Remember, the dimensions cannot be used as the components themselves in spring systems, because of the [[#Variable Component Vectors of Force Vectors Along a Spring|extendibility inherent ]]to the springs.
						So $\sum |\vec{F_{x}}| \space != -3\hat{i} + 4\hat{i}$  where $3\hat{i}$ and$4\hat{i}$ are the dimensions given.  
							But instead is:
								![[Pasted image 20240521133900.png]]
								![[Pasted image 20240521133914.png]]
								![[Pasted image 20240521134032.png]]
			The result is the magnitude of the Force Vector for $spring_{AC}$ (aka $\LARGE |\vec{F{s_{AC}}}|$) which is $15.848N$
				With this value, we can now find the "stretch" or displacement value of the spring AC (aka $\large s_{AC}$).
					$\LARGE F=kŒîx$.
						The problem gives $K_{AC}$ as $20{N\over m}$
						![[Pasted image 20240521134850.png]]
			To get the "stretch" ($\large s_{AB}$) of Force Vector AB ($\vec{F_{AB}}$) we need the spring Force Vector Magnitude ($|\LARGE \vec{F_{s{AB}}}|$).
				To obtain that we just plug in ($\LARGE \vec{F_{s_{AC}}}$) into our $\LARGE \vec{F_{x}}$ equilibrium equation.

					![[Pasted image 20240521135543.png]]
### Another Example: Translational Equilibrium in 2D Concurrent Particle Pulley/Cable Systems
![[Pasted image 20240522132039.png]]
*Note: the use of **cables in a pulley system** instead of springs.*
	*This means that the tension along the cable is equal on the both "sides of" - that is relative to the pulley fulcrum.*
		*Therefore, $\vec{T}$ appears on both sides of pulley.*
#### Steps
1. Create a [[#1. Draw Free Body Diagram Free Body Diagrams|Free Body Diagram]] for each component or point of the system that experiences different forces.
	![[Pasted image 20240522132355.png]]
1. Find Equilibrium Equations (i.e. find the magnitudes of the Force Vectors)
	1. Decompose the Force Vectors as Means to Find the Force Vector Magnitudes
		![[Pasted image 20240522162215.png]]
		![[Pasted image 20240522162418.png]]
		Now, we need to get the angle $\theta$ , but there is not enough info in the Equilibrium Equations alone.
			So we'll use the following info we do have:
				![[Pasted image 20240522213554.png]]
				![[Pasted image 20240522213643.png]]
				![[Pasted image 20240522213850.png]]
				![[Pasted image 20240522214016.png]]
				![[Pasted image 20240522214111.png]]
	2. Now we have $\theta = 45.57 \degree$ and we can plug it into the Equilibrium Equation for the $y$ component of the Force Vector, "T" in order to find the magnitude of $|\vec{T}|$ which is the tension along the cables.
		![[Pasted image 20240522214721.png]]
			*Remember T is a Force Vector with equal magnitude on both sides of the pulley*.
	3. Now we can solve for the $x$ dimension:
		![[Pasted image 20240523134133.png]]
		![[Pasted image 20240523134117.png]]
		![[Pasted image 20240523134328.png]]
		Because side opposite of $\theta$ are equal lengths or heights in this case:
			Where left $\theta$ = $x\tan \theta + 0.75$ and "right" $\theta$ = $3.5 - x \tan \theta$ and both are the same length.
				![[Pasted image 20240523134356.png]]
### Another Example: Translational Equilibrium in 3D Concurrent Particle Systems
![[Pasted image 20240523135417.png]]
*Note: this problem is in 3D so a z-axis (and z component vector of the Force Vector) and therefore, a z Equilibrium Equation is included.*
#### Steps
1. Create a [[#1. Draw Free Body Diagram Free Body Diagrams|Free Body Diagram]] for each component or point of the system that experiences different forces.
	*Note: this problem is already set in a free body diagram.*
2. Find the Equilibrium Equations
	1. Decompose the Force Vectors into their respective components. 
		1. $\vec{F_{1}}$ is along the x-axis.
			![[Pasted image 20240523140541.png]]
		2. $\vec{F_{2}}$ is in the y-z plane.
			![[Pasted image 20240523140619.png]]
		3. $\vec{F_{3}}$ is along the z-axis.
			![[Pasted image 20240523140634.png]]
		4. $\vec{F_{10}}$ is in the x-y plane.
			![[Pasted image 20240523142155.png]]
				*Note: this Equilibrium Equation is based on the proportion method.*
					*Where ${7 \over 25} = {\hat{i} \over 10}$*
		5. $\vec{F_{4}}$ is in the x-y plane.
			![[Pasted image 20240523214615.png]]
	2. Solve the Equilibrium Equations for each Axis. 
		1. And finally, find the magnitudes of F1, F2, F3
			![[Pasted image 20240523215335.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240524142359.png|600]]

#### Steps

	![[Pasted image 20240524142536.png|200]]
2. Find the Equilibrium Equations
	1. Decompose the Force Vectors into their respective components. 
		Because we are using Position Vectors, we need to:
			1. Find the Coordinates of the points themselves.

			2. Find the [[Static Equilibrium#The Force Vector of the Position Vector|Force Vector of the Position Vector ]]$\vec{F_{r}} = F_{r}\hat{u_{r}}$ (i.e. the component force vectors of the position vectors).

			1. Find the Resultant Force Vectors (component vectors, orientation and magnitude).

					1. We don't yet have the magnitude of $\vec{F_{DA}}$
						![[Pasted image 20240524143852.png]]
				2. $|\vec{F_{CD}}|$
					1. We don't yet have the magnitude of $\vec{F_{CD}}$

				3. $|\vec{F_{BD}}|$
					1. We don't yet have the magnitude of $\vec{F_{BD}}$

				4. $|\vec{F_{W}}| = 20\hat{k}$
	2. Solve Equilibrium Equations

			![[Pasted image 20240524150024.png]]

## [[Static Equilibrium#rotat|Rotational Equilibrium]] in Concurrent Systems
Rotational equilibrium in a concurrent system typically involves less complexity regarding [[Moment|torque]] since any forces acting through the same point do not create torque about that point. 
	Thus, if the forces are truly concurrent, the body does not experience rotational effects due to these forces. 
		However, this assumption depends strictly on the perfect concurrency of all force vectors at a single point, which is an idealized scenario.
			- **At the Point of Concurrency:**
			    - If you calculate the moment about the point where all force lines intersect (the concurrency point), the moment arm is zero, and thus the moment is zero.
			- **At Any Other Point:**
			    - If you calculate the moment about a different point (not the concurrency point), there will be a non-zero perpendicular distance from that point to the lines of action of the forces. Here, the forces can indeed create a moment because there is a lever arm.
### [[Moment]] of a Force
The moment of a force about a point is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate around that point. 
	It's often referred to as torque, but in [[Statics Analysis|statics]], it is typically called a moment.
