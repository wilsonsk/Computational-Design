# Newton's Second Law (i.e. Law of Force/Motion/Momentum)
**"When a net force acts on any body with mass, it produces an acceleration of that body. The net force will be equal to the mass of the body times the acceleration of the body."**

##### Fundamentally describes how the **velocity** of an object **changes** when it is subjected to external forces.
I.e. Is the analysis of acceleration - i.e. the change of an object's **velocity**. 
	I.e. Change in momentum - which is a static or constant velocity.

$\begin{equation*} \LARGE |\vec{F}| = {d(mv) \over (dt)} == m \times {dv \over dt} == {dp \over dp} == m \times |\vec{a}| \end{equation*}$ 

Where $d$ is "change", $\triangle$, $t$ is time, $v$ is [[#Velocity|velocity]], $p$ is [[#Momentum|momentum]].  

And where Force, $\vec{F}$ and [[#Acceleration|acceleration]], $\vec{a}$ are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction. 
	Mass, $m$, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity having only a magnitude. 
		The mass is scaled by the acceleration - i.e. for each unit within the total mass, there is one "level" of acceleration. 
			Then the sum total of these "levels" of acceleration equal to the force.
			
Based on the equation, it can be inferred that the **magnitude of the net force acting on the body** will be **equal to** the **mass of the body times the magnitude of the acceleration**.
	And that the direction of the net force on the body will be equal to the direction of the acceleration of the body.

## Velocity 
**Velocity** is a vector quantity that refers to the **rate of change of an object's position**. 
	It has both magnitude (speed) and direction, which distinguishes it from speed.
		Velocity tells us not only how fast an object is moving but also in which direction it is moving.

$\large v = {\triangle x \over \triangle t}$
	Where $v$ is velocity.
	$\triangle x$ is the change in the object's position (i.e. the displacement of the object) .
	$\triangle t$ is the change in time.

Velocity can be either **constant** or **variable**:
- If an object travels at a constant velocity, it moves in a straight line at a constant speed.
- If the velocity changes, it may do so in terms of magnitude (speed) or direction, or both.
###### Speed
A scalar quantity that does not involve direction. 
## Acceleration ¬†
**Acceleration** is a vector quantity that describes the **rate of change of velocity**.
	It indicates how quickly an object's velocity changes in magnitude (how fast it speeds up or slows down) and direction (how its direction of travel changes) over time. 
		An object accelerates if either its speed or direction (or both) changes.

$\large a = {\triangle v \over \triangle t}$
	Where $v$ is acceleration.
	$\triangle v$ is the change in the object's [[#Velocity|velocity]].
	$\triangle t$ is the change in time.
	
Acceleration can occur in various contexts:
###### Positive Acceleration
An increase in the magnitude of velocity (speeding up).
###### Negative Acceleration or Deceleration
A decrease in the magnitude of velocity (slowing down).
###### Centripetal Acceleration
A change in the direction of velocity, which occurs when an object moves in a circular path.
## Momentum
Momentum describes the **quantity of motion of a moving object**. 
	Momentum is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. 
		It is closely linked to the mass of the object and its velocity, and it plays a crucial role in the dynamics of moving systems.
##### Linear Momentum
Linear momentum ($p$) of an object is defined as the **product** of its **mass** ($m$) and its **velocity** ($v$). Mathematically, it is expressed as:
	$\large p=mv$

Where the object's velocity, $v$, is **scaled** by the object's mass, $m$.
	I.e. For 1 unit of mass, the object's velocity is applied. 
##### Angular Momentum:
Angular momentum ($L$) of an **object about a point** is defined as the **[[Structural Analysis#Cross Product|cross product]]** of the **[[Static Equilibrium#Position Vectors (a fourth method to "find" Resultant Force Vectors)|position vector]]** ($r$) relative to **the point and the linear momentum of the object**:
	$\large L=r√óp$
##### Law of Conservation of Momentum
Momentum is conserved in isolated systems, according to the law of conservation of momentum.
The conservation of linear momentum is a fundamental principle that holds in both isolated concurrent and non-concurrent systems. 
	This principle states that **unless external forces act on a system, its total linear momentum remains unchanged over time**. 
		This applies universally across physics, providing a critical tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of systems under various force conditions.
###### Conservation of [[#Linear Momentum|Linear Momentum]] 
In the absence of external forces, the total linear momentum of a non-concurrent system remains constant.
###### Conservation of [[#Angular Momentum|Angular Momentum]]
In the absence of external torques, the total angular momentum of the system about any point or axis remains constant.

## Angular Acceleration
Angular acceleration¬†is the rate of change of an object's rotational speed in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
## Rotational Motion:
Newton's second law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. 
	The revised version of the second law equation states that the **net [[Non-Concurrent Systems#Moments (i.e. Torque)|moment]]**, $\vec{M}$, acting on the object will be equal to the **mass moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation, (ùêº)** times the **angular acceleration of the body, $\vec{a}$**.

$\begin{equation*} \LARGE \vec{M} = I \times \vec{a} \end{equation*}$

The moment and the angular acceleration of the body have arrows above them, indicating that they are vector quantities with both a magnitude and direction. 
	The mass moment of inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity having only a magnitude. 
		The magnitude of the net moment will be equal to the mass moment of inertia times the magnitude of the angular acceleration, and the direction of the net moment will be equal to the direction of the angular acceleration.
