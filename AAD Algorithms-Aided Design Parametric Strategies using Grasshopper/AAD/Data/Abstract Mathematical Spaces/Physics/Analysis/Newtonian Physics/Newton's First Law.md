# Newton's First Law (i.e. the Law of Inertia)
**"A body at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. A body in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."**

This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia", means that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a force is applied to change that velocity. 
	If an object is at rest with zero velocity it will remain at rest until some force begins to change that velocity, and if an object is moving at a set speed and in a set direction it will remain at that same velocity until some force acts on it to change its velocity.
## Inertia
Inertia is the tendency of objects in motion to stay in motion and objects at rest to stay at rest, unless a force causes its speed or direction to change. 
	I.e. The tendency of an object to resist changes in their state of motion. 

$\LARGE I = {L \over \omega}$
	Where $I$ is inertia.
	Where $L$ is [[Newton's Second Law#Angular Momentum|angular momentum]].
	Where $\omega$ is [[Newton's Second Law#Angular Velocity|angular velocity]].
## Mass
Is the quantitative measure of inertia, a fundamental property of all matter.

$\LARGE m = {\rho \over V}$
	Where $m$ is mass.
	Where $\rho$ is **density**.
	Where $V$ is **volume**.
## Weight
Refers to the force acting on the object due to acceleration of gravity.
	Some standard textbooks define weight as a vector quantity, the gravitational force acting on the object. Others define weight as a scalar quantity, the magnitude of the gravitational force. 
	
$\LARGE W = mg$
	Where $W$ is weight.
	Where $m$ is mass.
	Where $g$ is [[Newton's Second Law#Acceleration|acceleration]] due to gravity.
## Density
Density is a substance's mass per unit of volume.

$\LARGE \rho = m \times V$
	Where $m$ is mass.
	Where $\rho$ is **density**.
	Where $V$ is **volume**.
## Volume
Is the amount of three-dimensional space occupied by matter or enclosed by a surface.

$\LARGE V = {\rho \over m}$
	Where $m$ is mass.
	Where $\rho$ is **density**.
	Where $V$ is **volume**.
## Net Forces
It is important to note that the **net force** is what will cause a change in [[Newton's Second Law#Velocity|velocity]]. 
	The net force is the sum of all forces acting on the body. 
		*For example*, we can imagine gently pushing on the rock in the figure above and observing that the rock does not move. 
			This is because we will have a friction force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction opposing our gentle pushing force. 
				The sum of these two forces will be equal to zero, therefore the net force is zero and the change in velocity is zero.
## [[Euclidean Transformations#Rotations|Rotational]] [[Newton's Second Law#Motion|Motion]]
Newton's first law also applies to [[Statics Analysis#Moments (i.e. Torque)|moments]] and rotational velocities.
	A body will maintain it's current rotational velocity until a net moment is exerted to change that rotational velocity.
		 This can be seen in things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that will continue spinning once started until brakes or friction stop them.
