# Second Derivatives
The second derivative of a function $f(x)$, denoted as $f′′(x)$ or $d^2y/d^2x$​.
Is the derivative of the first derivative. 
	I.e. It is the rate at which the slope of the tangent line of a point of the curve $f(x)$ changes with $𝑥$. 
		This tells us how the rate of change itself (of the slope of the tangent line) is changing.
		
What $f′′(x)$ tells you is how the slope of the original function $f(x)$ is changing. 
	For instance, is the slope becoming steeper? Is it leveling off? Is it curving upwards or downwards?

Understanding the second derivative is crucial for analyzing the behavior or dynamics of a function beyond just their increasing or decreasing nature. 
## Concavity
If $f′′(x)>0$ (the second derivative is positive), 
	Then the original function $f(x)$ is concave up (like a cup), meaning its slope is increasing. 
	
If $f′′(x)<0$ (the second derivative is negative), 
	Then function is concave down (like a cap), meaning its slope is decreasing.
## [[Curves#Inflection Point|Inflection]] Points
Points where 𝑓′′(𝑥)=0f′′(x)=0 might be inflection points, where the function changes the direction of its curvature—from concave up to concave down, or vice versa.
## Application in [[Dynamics Analysis#Acceleration|Analysis]]: Acceleration
###### Position $= v(t)$ 
This is a function of time $(t)$. 
It describes where an object is located at any time $t$.
###### Velocity $= v'(t)$ is the derivative of $v(t)$ i.e. the [[Limits|limit]] of the [[Secant Line#The Average Rate of Change|average rate of change]] of a position.
Represents how fast the position is changing at any given moment.
	Velocity tells you the rate at which an object moves away from its starting position.

###### Acceleration $= v''(t)$ is the derivative of $v'(t)$ i.e. the [[Limits|limit]] of the [[Secant Line#The Average Rate of Change|average rate of change]] of the limit of the average rate of change.
Represents how fast the velocity is changing at any given moment.
	Acceleration tells you the rate at which the velocity of an object is increasing or decreasing.

### Graphical Representation:
If you graph position (x) versus time (t), the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point gives the velocity at that time.
If you graph velocity (v) versus time (t), the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point gives the acceleration at that time.
