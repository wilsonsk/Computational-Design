# Second Derivatives
The second derivative of a function $f(x)$, denoted as $f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(x)$ or $d^2y/d^2x$‚Äã.
Is the derivative of the first derivative. 
	I.e. It is the rate at which the slope of the curve $f(x)$ changes with $ùë•$. 
		This tells us how the rate of change itself is changing.

Understanding the second derivative is crucial for analyzing the behavior or dynamics of a function beyond just their increasing or decreasing nature. 

## Acceleration
Acceleration is indeed the second derivative of position with respect to time
described as the first derivative of velocity with respect to time.
