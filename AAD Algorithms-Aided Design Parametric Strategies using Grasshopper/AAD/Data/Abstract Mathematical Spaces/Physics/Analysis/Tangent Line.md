# Tangent Line
Touches the **curve of a function** **exactly once**.

The [[Secant Line|Secant Line]] touches a curve of a function at least twice. 
	The tangent touches just one of those points (of secant line) at exactly on point on the tangent line.
## Represents a [[Proportion#Visually Represented by the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle|Proportion]]
### As the [[Proportion#Visually it is the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle|Hypotenuse]] of the Triangle Representing the [[Derivatives#Is a Proportion Proportion|Derivative]] 
It represents $\Delta y / \Delta x$ where $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ are the **adjacent** and **opposite** sides of that connect to the tangent line and to each other.
Therefore, creating a triangle where the tangent is the **hypotenuse**. 
	And again, this "hypotenuse" i.e. tangent line **only touches the curve of a function exactly once**.
		I.e. Only a **single point** on the **tangent line** **touches a curve of a function in exactly one point**.

## The Slope of a Secant Line 
The Secant Line connects two points on a curve.

The Slope of the Secant Line gives an average rate of change between those two points.

As the two points get closer to each other, the secant line approaches the tangent line at a single point on the curve.

Mathematically, if you have a function $f(x)$ and two points on the curve, $(x1,f(x1))$ and $(x2,f(x2))$:
	Then the slope of the secant line is given by:
		$\LARGE \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$

When $x_2$​ approaches $x_1$​, this slope approaches the derivative of $f$ at $x_1$, which is the slope of the tangent line at that point.
	In the limit as $x_2$ approaches $x_1$​, the secant line becomes the tangent line. 
		This is represented as:
			$\LARGE \lim_{x_2 \to x_1} \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = f'(x_1)$

Therefore, as the two points defining the secant line get infinitesimally close, the slope of the secant line approximates the slope of the tangent line.
