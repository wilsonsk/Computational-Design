# Tangent Line
Touches the **curve of a function** **exactly once**.

The [[Secant Line|Secant Line]] touches a curve of a function at least twice. 
	The tangent touches just one of those points (of secant line) at exactly on point on the tangent line.
## Represents a [[Proportion#Visually Represented by the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle|Proportion]]
### As the [[Proportion#Visually it is the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle|Hypotenuse]] of the Triangle Representing the [[Derivatives#Is a Proportion Proportion|Derivative]] 
It represents $\Delta y / \Delta x$ where $\Delta y$ and  $\Delta x$ are the **adjacent** and **opposite** sides of that connect to the tangent line and to each other.
Therefore, creating a triangle where the tangent is the **hypotenuse**. 
	And again, this "hypotenuse" i.e. tangent line **only touches the curve of a function exactly once**.
		I.e. Only a **single point** on the **tangent line** **touches a curve of a function in exactly one point**.

## The [[Derivatives#Is the Tangent Line The Slope of a Tangent Line Slope (i.e. a proportion/rate/ratio between $ Delta y / Delta x$) of the Tangent Line Tangent Line|Slope]] of a Tangent Line
Is the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of that single point along the curve of a function.
