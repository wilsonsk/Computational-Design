## The Concept of Change
##### [[Derivatives#Difference Quotient I.e. The (Average/Instantaneous) Rate of Change|Average Rate of Change]]

- **Definition**: Measures how much the output of a function changes on average for a given change in the input.
- **Example**: If a car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, the average speed is: Average Speed=100 miles2 hours=50 miles per hour\text{Average Speed} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}Average Speed=2 hours100 miles​=50 miles per hour

## The Difference Quotient

- **Objective**: To understand the concept of the difference quotient and how it relates to the average rate of change.

##### 2.1 Definition and Formula

- **Difference Quotient**: f(x+h)−f(x)h\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}hf(x+h)−f(x)​
- **Interpretation**: Represents the average rate of change of the function $f(x)$ over the interval $[x, x+h]$.
- **Components**:
    - **Numerator ($f(x+h) - f(x)$)**: Change in the function's value (dependent variable).
    - **Denominator ($h$)**: Change in the independent variable.

##### 2.2 Geometric Interpretation

- **Secant Line**: The line connecting the points $(x, f(x))$ and $(x+h, f(x+h))$ on the graph of the function.
- **Slope of the Secant Line**: The difference quotient $\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ gives the slope of this secant line.

#### Section 3: Limits and the Transition to the Derivative

- **Objective**: To explore the concept of limits and how the difference quotient leads to the derivative.

##### 3.1 Introduction to Limits

- **Definition**: A limit examines the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value.
- **Example**: lim⁡h→0f(x+h)\lim_{h \to 0} f(x+h)h→0lim​f(x+h)

##### 3.2 Connecting Limits to the Difference Quotient

- **Limit of the Difference Quotient**: f′(x)=lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)hf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}f′(x)=h→0lim​hf(x+h)−f(x)​
- **Interpretation**: As $h$ approaches zero, the secant line approaches the tangent line at $x$, and the difference quotient becomes the instantaneous rate of change, or the derivative.

#### Section 4: The Derivative

- **Objective**: To understand the derivative as the limit of the difference quotient and its geometric and practical significance.

##### 4.1 Definition and Notation

- **Derivative**: The instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point.
- **Formula**: f′(x)=lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)hf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}f′(x)=h→0lim​hf(x+h)−f(x)​

##### 4.2 Geometric Interpretation

- **Tangent Line**: The line that just touches the curve at a point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.
- **Slope of the Tangent Line**: The derivative $f'(x)$ represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at $x$.

#### Section 5: Differentials

- **Objective**: To introduce differentials and their relationship to derivatives and the difference quotient.

##### 5.1 Understanding Differentials

- **Differential Notation**:
    - **$dx$**: Infinitesimally small change in the independent variable.
    - **$dy$**: Infinitesimally small change in the dependent variable.

##### 5.2 Connecting Differentials to the Difference Quotient

- **As $h$ Approaches Zero**:
    - **Numerator ($f(x+h) - f(x)$)** becomes $dy$, the differential of the dependent variable.
    - **Denominator ($h$)** becomes $dx$, the differential of the independent variable.
- **Derivative in Differential Form**: f′(x)=dydxf'(x) = \frac{dy}{dx}f′(x)=dxdy​

#### Section 6: Summary and Intuitive Understanding

- **Objective**: To consolidate understanding and highlight the intuitive connections between the key concepts.

##### 6.1 Summary

- **Difference Quotient**: Measures the average rate of change (slope of the secant line).
- **Limit**: Process of making the interval $h$ approach zero.
- **Derivative**: Instantaneous rate of change (slope of the tangent line).
- **Differentials**: Infinitesimally small changes in the independent and dependent variables.

##### 6.2 Intuitive Understanding

- **Average vs. Instantaneous Rate of Change**: The difference quotient gives the average rate of change, while the derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change as the interval shrinks to zero.
- **Geometric Connection**: The transition from secant line to tangent line through the limit process.
