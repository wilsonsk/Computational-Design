# Multivariable Calculus
Multivariable calculus deals with functions that have more than one input variable.
	For example, instead of a function $f(x)$ that depends on a single variable $x$, we might have a function $f(x, y)$ that depends on two variables $x$ and $y$, or a function $f(x, y, z)$ that depends on three variables $x$, $y$, and $z$.
