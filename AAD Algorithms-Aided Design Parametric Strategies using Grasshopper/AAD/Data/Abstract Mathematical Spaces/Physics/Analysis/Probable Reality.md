# Probable Reality

## A Model of Reality and Time

### A Recursive Loop
#### The OS/DELTA-t Loop
1. DELTA-t is incremented.
2. Free will choices, material changes, and energy changes are
made, defining a new OS state vector associated with the current
DELTA-t.
3. The new OS state vector is compared to the previous one and to
the predicted one.
4. All actualized changes between the new and previous OS states
are recorded. Predictive algorithms and databases are updated
and improved.
5. TBC calculates M sequential probable future states of the new
OS by running a delta-t sub-loop.
6. Entire OS state vector including all significant possibilities and
probabilities is recorded
7. The loop is returned to step 1
8. 8. DELTA-t is incremented.
9. Free will choices, material changes, and energy
changes are made, defining a new OS state vector
associated with the current DELTA-t.
10. The new OS state vector is compared to the
previous one and to the predicted one.
11. All actualized changes between the new and
previous OS states are recorded. Predictive
algorithms and databases are updated and
improved.
12. TBC calculates M sequential probable future

states of the new OS by running a delta-t sub-
loop.
