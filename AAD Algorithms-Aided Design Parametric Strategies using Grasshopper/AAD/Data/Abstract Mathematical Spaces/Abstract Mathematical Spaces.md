# Abstract Mathematical Spaces
## The Abstract, Non-Physical Environment
**Fundamentally** a **scale** is **defined** by the **Mathematical, Abstract, Non-Physical Environment** that **defines** and **constrains** the Mathematical Abstract Non-Physical **Objects** and their behaviors and interactions that are **analyzed** at that scale.
	It employed because it facilitates clear, objectively causal relationships between these abstract objects.
		Thereby, defining and enabling these Abstract Mathematical Objects and their behaviors (possible [[#State|states]], properties, conditions, parameters) and the interactions (i.e. rules of interactions and relations) defined between them (called "additional structure).

Defines the scales, quantum to macro of the object and their interactions and behaviors.
###### Reduction of Complexity: 
A non-physical abstract environment reduces complexity by isolating mathematical concepts from physical attributes. This allows mathematicians to focus on logical relationships without interference from external factors like measurement errors or material properties​​.
###### Facilitation of Clear, Objective Causality: 
Abstract environments provide a setting where relationships between mathematical objects are governed by pure logic, enabling clear, objective causality between them. This clarity helps mathematicians to deduce properties and explore mathematical truths through proofs and axioms​​.
###### Elimination of Ambiguity (i.e. clear, agreed upon, unambiguous definitions): 
In abstract mathematics, concepts are defined rigorously through axioms and definitions, avoiding the ambiguity that can occur in the physical world​​. This allows mathematicians to draw clear conclusions and develop theories with internal consistency.

## A Hierarchy
The hierarchy from the most fundamental mathematical concepts (universal superset) to fields, spaces, categories, etc., is structured by increasing levels of complexity and structure.
	Each subsequent level derives its elements and properties from the more fundamental levels, creating a layered approach to mathematical concepts.

## Structured Set (i.e. Space)
A subset of the Universal Superset.

When a set is endowed with a structure, it becomes a "structured set" or "space."
	"Structure" refers to additional operations, relations, and properties that are defined on a set to give it more meaning or to make it useful for certain purposes. 
		The structure itself is not a set but rather a framework of rules and operations applied to a set.

Structured sets are formed by taking a subset of the underlying set and adding a structure to it. 
	The additional structure defines how the elements of the underlying set interact.
		I.e. The combination of the underlying set and the additional structure. 
#### Space
The space refers to the set together with the defined structure (i.e. the operations and properties).

In mathematics, a **space** is a [[#Set Theory|set]] (sometimes known as a universe (i.e. a collection that contains all the entities one wishes to consider in a given situation) with a definition of relationships among the [[Abstract Mathematical Objects|Mathematical Objects]] of the set.
	Where "definition of relationships" refers to the "structure" of the space.
		And the "Mathematical Objects" refer to the elements of the underlying set within the space.
			Although the operations and functions of the space are also technically Mathematical Objects.

A space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as [[Points|points]].
and selected relationships between these points.
	The nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can represent numbers, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. 
		It is the relationships (i.e. Morphisms) that define the nature of the space.
#### Structure
Structure on a set is the specification of additional operations, relations, and axioms that the set must satisfy. 
	The structure defines how the elements of the set interact and behave according to certain rules.
###### Adding Structure to a Set
By defining operations ***on*** a set and imposing certain rules or axioms, we can impart structure to the set.
	"**Defining on a set**", means that the operation, function, or property is specified in such a way that it applies to the elements of the set and governs their interactions.
		This definition imparts structure to the set, transforming it into a structured set or space with specific mathematical properties.
##### Components that compose the "Structure" of a Structured Set
1. **Set**: 
	The underlying collection of elements.
		These are the Mathematical Objects of the Space.
2. **Operations**:
	Functions defined on the elements of the set (e.g., addition, multiplication).
		These are specific functions or rules that describe how the elements of the set interact.
3. **Axioms (Properties)**: 
	Rules or conditions that the operations must satisfy (e.g., associativity, commutativity, distributivity).
		These are the conditions or rules that the operations must satisfy to ensure the set behaves in a particular way.

## Types of Structured Sets (i.e. Spaces)

### 1. Algebraic Structured Sets
**Groups, Rings, Fields**: These terms come from the field of abstract algebra, where the focus is on algebraic operations and properties. They have been studied extensively and have well-established definitions and theories.

Groups, rings, and fields **are** technically types of structured sets or spaces, as they all consist of sets with additional operations and axioms. 
	The distinction often arises from the historical development and the specific contexts in which these terms are used.
		Using specific terms like "group," "ring," and "field" helps to precisely describe the nature of the structure and the specific operations and axioms involved. 
			This precision is crucial in mathematical discussions and writings to avoid ambiguity.

Therefore, despite technically being structured sets (spaces), they are not referred to as such. 
	While these can be viewed as "spaces" in a broad sense, they represent more narrowly defined structures compared to the wide variety of possible "spaces."
#### Groups
A set equipped with a single binary operation that satisfies the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses).
#### Rings
A set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy the ring axioms (additive commutativity, additive associativity, distributivity, etc.).

**Origin of the Term**
	The term "ring" comes from the German word "Zahlring," introduced by David Hilbert.
		 It refers to the cyclical nature of addition and multiplication operations within the set, similar to a ring structure where operations bring you back to elements within the set.
#### Fields
A set that is a commutative ring with the additional property that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

**Origin of the Term**
The term "field" (German: "Körper") was introduced by Richard Dedekind. 
	In English, "field" was chosen to reflect the idea of a set with both additive and multiplicative operations that can be inverted (except for zero).
	
A field can be thought of as a "field" of numbers where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, reflecting a rich, fertile structure allowing for extensive arithmetic operations.
### 2. "Spaces" (Not Purely Algebraic)
The term "space" can refer to **any** set with additional structure, whether algebraic, topological, or geometric.
	Spaces often incorporate geometric or topological structures, such as distances, open sets, norms, and inner products, which are not typically considered in the purely algebraic structures of groups, rings, and fields.
> [!NOTE] ###### Metric Spaces
> Metric Spaces: A set with a distance function (metric) defined between elements.
	>**Example**: The set $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual distance function $d(x, y) = |x - y|$.
> ###### Topological Spaces
> Topological Spaces: A set with a topology, a collection of open sets satisfying certain axioms.
	> **Example**: The real line $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology.
> ###### Normed Spaces
> Normed Spaces: A vector space on which a norm is defined.
> 	**Example**: The set of all continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm, denoted $C([0,1])$.

	> **Example**: The space of all continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm, denoted $C([0,1])$.
> ###### Hilbert Spaces

	> **Example**: The space of square-integrable functions, denoted $L^2([0,1])$.
> ###### Function Spaces
> Function Spaces: A set of functions from one space to another, often equipped with additional structure like pointwise operations or norms.
> 	**Example**: The set $C([0,1])$ of all continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$.
> ###### Measure Spaces

> ###### Fiber Bundles
> Fiber Bundles: A space that is locally a product space but globally may have a different topological structure.
> 	**Example**: The Möbius strip.
> ###### Sobolev Spaces
> Sobolev Spaces: Function spaces that can accommodate derivatives up to a certain order.
> 	**Example**: The set of functions on $[0,1]$ with square-integrable first derivatives, denoted $W^{1,2}([0,1])$.

## Structuring/Equipping a Set (i.e. Space)
This term describes the process of defining operations and properties on an underlying set to form a structured set or space.

This refers to the general process of starting with an underlying set and defining operations, properties, and axioms to create a more complex mathematical object.
### The Relationship Between a Structured Set and the Underlying Set
#### Underlying Set is More Fundamental Than the Structured Set
An underlying set is more fundamental than the structure in the sense that it serves as the basic collection of elements upon which the structure is built.
	The structure is built on top of this set by defining specific operations and axioms, creating a more complex and rich mathematical object, and ensuring these operations satisfy certain properties and axioms.
### Sequence of Steps in Structuring a Set
##### 1. Start with an Underlying Set
Identify the basic set of elements that will form the foundation of the structured set.
- **Example**: The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
##### 2. Define Operations
Specify the operations that will be performed on the elements of the underlying set.
- **Example**:
    - Vector addition:
	    $$(x_1, y_1, z_1) + (x_2, y_2, z_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, z_1 + z_2)$$
    - Scalar multiplication: For a scalar $\LARGE a \in \mathbb{R}$
	    $$\LARGE a \cdot (x, y, z) = (a x, a y, a z)$$
##### 3. Define Properties and Axioms
- **Properties**: Specify the properties that the operations must satisfy to ensure the set becomes a well-defined structured set.
- **Axioms**: These are formal statements that the operations and elements must satisfy.
> [!note] Examples
> - Associativity of addition: $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})$
> - Commutativity of addition: $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}$
> - Identity element of addition: There exists a zero vector $\mathbf{0}$ such that $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{u}$
> - Inverse elements of addition: For each vector $\mathbf{u}$, there exists a vector $-\mathbf{u}$ such that $\mathbf{u} + (-\mathbf{u}) = $\mathbf{0}$
> - Distributivity: $a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}$ and $(a + b)\mathbf{u} = a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{u}$
##### 4. Form the Structured Set
- **Resulting Set**: Combine the underlying set with the defined operations and properties to form the structured set.
- **Example**: The set $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the defined operations and axioms forms a vector space.

## The Frameworks for Abstract Mathematical Space
Describing and Comparing Abstract Mathematical Space
### Set Theory as a Foundation for Abstract Environments
##### Structural Frameworks
**Abstract Mathematical Spaces** are **sets equipped with [[#Additional Structure (not equivalent to Mathematical Structure)|additional structure]]**, which defines operations, relations, or other **properties** that **define** **how** **[[#Underlying Set (i.e. Base Set)|elements]]** of the **set** (which the Abstract Space also contains within it) **interact** and **relate** to **each** **other**.
#### Set Theory
Set theory provides the **foundational framework** for **describing and defining abstract mathematical environments/spaces**. 
	It does so by formalizing the concept of a collection of objects, which can include anything from numbers and geometric points to functions and other more complex structures. 
###### The [[#Underlying Set (i.e. Base Set)|Underlying Set]]: Basic Elements - Sets: 
- **Definition of Sets**: In set theory, a set is defined simply as a collection of distinct objects, which can be anything—mathematical, conceptual, or even physical. These objects are called the elements or members of the set.
- **Examples**: Sets can include the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,...}{1,2,3,...}, the set of points in a geometric space, or the set of solutions to a particular equation.
###### The [[#Additional Structure (not equivalent to Mathematical Structure)|Additional Structure Set]]: Structure and Operations on Sets:
- **Operations**: Set theory introduces several fundamental operations that can be performed with sets, such as union, intersection, set difference, and complement. These operations allow for the construction of new sets from existing ones, providing a way to build more complex structures and relationships.
- **Subsets and Power Sets**: The concept of subsets (sets wholly contained within another set) and power sets (the set of all possible subsets of a set) are central in exploring the internal structure of sets and their potential complexity.
- **Function and Mappings**:
	- **Functions as Set Relations**: Functions are defined in set theory as a special kind of relation (itself a set of ordered pairs) that assigns exactly one element of one set to each element of another set. Functions are crucial for describing transformations and interactions between elements of sets and thus are integral to defining abstract mathematical operations within environments.
	- **Injective, Surjective, Bijective**: These concepts describe how functions relate sets to each other, crucial for understanding structure preservation in more complex mathematical contexts.
- **Foundational Axioms**:
	- **Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC)**: The axiomatic system most commonly used today in set theory. These axioms formalize the behavior of sets under various operations and conditions, providing a rigorous foundation for most of modern mathematics.
	- **Axioms**: Include axioms that describe how sets are formed, how they can be compared, and what constitutes an element of a set. These rules form the basis for virtually all mathematical analysis performed in more complex abstract environments.
**Defining Abstract Mathematical Environments**:
- **Role in Other Disciplines**: Set theory's concepts are used to define the spaces and structures in other areas of mathematics. For example, in topology, a topological space is defined as a set of points along with a set of "open" subsets that satisfy certain properties. In algebra, structures like groups, rings, and fields are defined using sets equipped with one or more operations.
**Universality**: 
The general applicability of set theory makes it a universal language for discussing and defining abstract mathematical environments across all fields of mathematics and related disciplines.
### Category Theory
Category theory extends beyond traditional set theory by focusing on the relationships between structures rather than just the structures themselves. 

Category theory provides a [[#Higher-Level Set Set (i.e. Category/Class of Structures/Universal)|high-level framework]] (i.e. the set containing the [[#Structured Set|Structured Set]]) for describing and comparing Abstract Mathematical Environments as well as mathematical structures by emphasizing the relationships between abstract mathematical objects and the structure-preserving transformations (functors) that can exist between different categories.
	I.e. By **abstracting the essence of mathematical objects and focusing on how they interact.**
		This makes it a cornerstone of modern mathematical theory, enabling a deeper understanding of structures and their interrelations across various branches of mathematics and beyond.

A category is defined by a **set of objects** and **morphisms** (arrows) between those objects that satisfy certain compositional properties. 
![[Pasted image 20240421082147.png|400]]
##### Morphisms 
- **Primary Focus**: In category theory, the primary focus is on the relationships (morphisms) between objects. This perspective is particularly useful for comparing how different structures behave and interact, rather than just comparing the structures (objects) themselves.
- **Composition of Morphisms**: Morphisms can be composed, meaning if there is a morphism from object A to object B, and another from B to C, then there must also be a morphism from A to C. This composition must be associative, and for each object, there must be an identity morphism that acts as a neutral element in morphism composition.
##### Functors and Natural Transformations:
- **[[Mapping|Mapping]]**s:
	- These tools in category theory allow for the mapping of objects and morphisms in one category to objects and morphisms in another, preserving their structural relationships. 
	- Functors are mappings between categories that preserve the structure defined by objects and morphisms.
	- A functor maps objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms, respecting the compositional structure (i.e., it preserves identities and compositions). 
	- Functors are essential for relating different categories and for transferring properties and structures between them.
	- Functors can compare and relate different abstract environments, while natural transformations provide a way to compare functors.
- **Natural Transformations**:
	- These provide a way to transform one functor into another while respecting the structure of the categories involved. 
	- Natural transformations are central in expressing how one categorical construction can be morphed into another smoothly.
##### Higher-Level Structures (Not Higher-Level Sets):
- **Limits and Colimits**:
	- Category theory defines concepts like limits and colimits, which generalize constructions such as products, coproducts, intersections, and unions. These are crucial for discussing completeness and the existence of certain universal properties in categories.
- **Adjunctions**: 
	- An adjunction is a pair of functors that go between two categories, which are universal with respect to a certain property. Adjunctions help in defining free objects and forgetful functors and are pivotal in linking different mathematical contexts.
###### Versatility in Application:
Category theory is not restricted to any specific type of mathematical structure. It can describe sets, spaces, groups, rings, vector spaces, and more, as long as these can be conceptualized as objects with morphisms between them. This versatility makes it a powerful tool for describing a wide range of abstract environments.

The abstract environment in category theory is the entire category itself, which abstractly encapsulates the objects and their interactions.
