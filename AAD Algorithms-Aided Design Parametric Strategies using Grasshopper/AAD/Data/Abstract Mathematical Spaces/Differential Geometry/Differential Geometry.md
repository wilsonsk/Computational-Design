# Differential Geometry
Differential geometry is a branch of mathematics that uses techniques of calculus and linear algebra to study geometric problems. 
	It focuses on the properties of curves, surfaces, and more general geometric structures that are smooth (i.e., [[Derivatives#Differentiable Function|differentiable]]).

The term "**[[Derivatives#Differential|differential]]**" refers to a [[Linear Map|linear map]] that approximates how [[Functions|functions]] or maps change in a smooth and consistent manner at an infinitesimal level.
	This concept is central to understanding how [[Curves|curves]] and [[Surfaces|surfaces]] behave and interact locally.

## Key Components of Differential Geometry
#### Parametrization
Parametrization is the process of defining a curve by expressing its coordinates as functions of one or more parameters.
	***Example***: For a circle of radius $R$, a common parametrization is 
	$$(x(t), y(t)) = (R \cos(t), R \sin(t))$$
	where $t$ is the parameter.
#### Curves and Surfaces
###### Curves
One-dimensional objects in space, like the path of a moving point.
###### Surfaces
Two-dimensional objects, like the skin of a 3D shape.
#### Smoothness and Differentiability
###### Smoothness
A smooth curve or surface has no sharp edges or breaks; it's continuously differentiable.
###### Differentiability
A function is differentiable if it has a derivative at each point, which means it can be approximated by a tangent line or plane at very small scales.
#### Tangent Spaces
###### Tangent Space
At any point on a smooth curve or surface, the tangent space is a linear approximation of the geometry at that point. It's essentially the best flat surface that approximates the curve or surface locally.
#### Curvature
###### Curvature
Measures how much a curve deviates from being a straight line, or a surface deviates from being a plane.
###### Types of Curvature
Includes Gaussian curvature (intrinsic curvature) and mean curvature (extrinsic curvature).
#### Metrics
###### Metric
Defines the distance between points on a curve or surface. In differential geometry, metrics help quantify how shapes change and deform.
