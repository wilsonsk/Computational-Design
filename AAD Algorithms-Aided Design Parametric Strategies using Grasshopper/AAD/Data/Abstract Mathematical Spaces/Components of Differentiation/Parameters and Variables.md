# Parameters and Variables
In the most **abstract sense**, within the context of **differentiation** and **[[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Differentiation is the Mechanism of Change|differentiated states]]**, **parameters** and **variables** serve as fundamental components that describe **how** and **what** aspects of a system can **vary**. 
	Their definitions and roles help frame the **process of differentiation**, which is the method of distinguishing distinct possibilities or potential outcomes within a system.
## Variables
**Variables** represent the **aspects of the system that are free to vary** or change. 
	In the context of differentiation, variables capture **how much** a differentiated state can change within the potential defined by the system.

Variables are **abstracted expressions** of the **potential for variation**. 
	They allow the system to **differentiate** along different axes or dimensions. 
		The act of differentiation assigns variables to specific dimensions, representing the measurable ways in which the system can **vary** or **change** within the space of potential.

**Variables** are the **quantitative markers** of a differentiated state.
	They express the system's **configuration** in terms of measurable values, which describe the **state’s position** relative to its potential variance.
### Variables as Degrees of Freedom
Abstractly, variables are the **degrees of freedom** that express the **potential for variance** along a particular dimension.
	Each variable represents an **axis** or **property** that can assume different values, defining the ways in which the system can change or be measured.
	    - **Example**: In a 2D system, xx and yy are variables representing two degrees of freedom (e.g., space). Each variable quantifies how far the system has moved or varied along these axes.
### Variables as Quantifications
Variables are **quantifications** of a system’s **state**.
	They don’t inherently represent the essence of a differentiated state but rather provide **measurements** or **values** that describe the current configuration of that state.
	    - **Example**: If a system has the potential to change spatially, then the variable xx would be a **quantitative representation** of position along the x-axis. The values of xx quantify how much the system has changed within that dimension.

### Variables as Differentiated Potentials
Variables represent the **outcomes** of differentiation—the quantitative ways in which the system’s potential for variance can be measured. 
	They describe the **specific instances** that emerge from differentiation, representing measurable change within the system.
## Parameters
Parameters represent the **constraints** or **defining conditions** that shape how variables behave. 
	They are the **controllers** or **regulators** of a system’s behavior, setting the **conditions** that the variables must follow.

Parameters are used to **differentiate** by imposing **specific conditions** on how the system can change.
	They act as **boundary markers** that limit and structure the potential variability within a system.

**Parameters** are the **definers** of a differentiated state because they determine **how variables are constrained**. 
	The differentiated state of a system is defined not only by the values of its variables but also by the **configuration of its parameters**, which set the rules for how the variables interact.

**[[AAD Algorithms-Aided Design Parametric Strategies using Grasshopper/AAD/Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Components of Differentiation/Parametrization|Parametrization]]** is the process by which a system's potential is **structured** or **differentiated**.
	It sets up the relational conditions that allow for specific **instances** of the system to emerge, turning the abstract potential of differentiation into a **well-defined state**.
### Parameters as Constraints
Abstractly, parameters impose **boundaries** or **rules** that govern how the system can differentiate.
	They define the **limits** or **ranges** within which variables can change, serving to **structure** the behavior of the system.
	    - **Example**: In a linear system like y=ax+by=ax+b, the parameters aa and bb control the **slope** and **intercept** of the line, effectively shaping how the variable yy changes with respect to xx. Here, parameters govern the **relationship** between the variables.
### Parameters as Definers of Relational Structure
Parameters define the **relational structure** that variables must adhere to. 
	They describe how **variables interact** with each other or with the system’s underlying framework.
		 The values of parameters serve as **conditions** that shape the system’s behavior, introducing **constraints** that limit the ways in which variables can vary.
## The Relationship Between Variables and Parameters
### As Differentiated States
**Differentiated states** are the **instances** of a system that arise when variables are assigned specific values within the constraints imposed by parameters. 
	The differentiated state of a system is defined by the **interaction** between variables and parameters.

**Parameters constrain variables**, leading to the emergence of specific **instances** that satisfy the relational structure defined by those parameters. 
	In this sense, differentiation is the process of **imposing constraints** (through parameters) on **potential variance** (expressed by variables) to produce **distinct, differentiated instances**.
