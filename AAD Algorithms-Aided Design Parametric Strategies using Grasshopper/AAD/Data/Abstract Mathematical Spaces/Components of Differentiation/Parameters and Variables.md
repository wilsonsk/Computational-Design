# Parameters and Variables
In the most **abstract sense**, within the context of **differentiation** and **[[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Differentiation is the Mechanism of Change|differentiated states]]**, **parameters** and **variables** serve as fundamental components that describe **how** and **what** aspects of a system can **vary**. 
	Their definitions and roles help frame the **process of differentiation**, which is the method of distinguishing distinct possibilities or potential outcomes within a system.
## Variables
Variables are **abstracted expressions** of the **potential for variation**. 
	They allow the system to **differentiate** along different axes or dimensions. 
		The act of differentiation assigns variables to specific dimensions, representing the measurable ways in which the system can **vary** or **change** within the space of potential.

**Variables** are the **quantitative markers** of a differentiated state.
	They express the system's **configuration** in terms of measurable values, which describe the **state’s position** relative to its potential variance.
### Variables as Differentiated Potentials (i.e. [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#A Second Differentiation as a Second (Independent) Dimension|Second-Level Differentiation]])
**Variables** represent the specific states ***of*** **aspects of the system that are free to vary** or change. 
	In the context of differentiation, variables capture **how much** a differentiated state can change within the potential defined by the system.

- **Dimensions** provide the abstract **potential** for change or variance (first-level differentiation).
- **Parameters** define the **constraints** or **rules** that structure how a dimension behaves (second-level differentiation).
- **Variables** emerge as **quantified instances** within the system, representing the **specific values** that variables can take, **within the constraints** defined by parameters (third-level differentiation).
### Variables as Degrees of Freedom
They are the **quantitative representations** of how much a system varies along that dimension.

Abstractly, variables are the **degrees of freedom** that express the **potential for variance** along a particular dimension.
	Each variable represents an **axis** or **property** that can assume different values, defining the ways in which the system can change or be measured.
	    **Example**: In a 2D system, $x$ and $y$ are variables representing two degrees of freedom (e.g., space). 
		    Each variable quantifies how far the system has moved or varied along these axes.
### Variables with Infinite Degrees of Freedom
In an **abstract sense**, a **variable** can have **infinite degrees of freedom** when it is **unconstrained** and free to take on **any value** within its dimension.
	In this case, the variable represents **pure potential** for change, with no restrictions or boundaries imposed on it. 
		I.e. A variable with infinite degrees of freedom **represents the system’s maximum potential for variation**.

The variable is not yet bound by any **parameters** or **constraints**.
	The system is in an initial, **undifferentiated state**, meaning that the variable can span the entire **domain** of possible values.
		The system has not yet been **defined** or **refined** by additional structures.
### Variables as [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Quantification (of the First Dimension) as the Outcome of Parametrization of the First Dimension|Quantifications]] (i.e. [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#3. Third-Level Differentiation (Definition of an Instance to a Defined Constraint within the Defined Dimension Quantification Implemented by Value Assignment)|Third-Level Differentiation]])
Variables are **quantifications** of a system’s **state**.
	They don’t inherently represent [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#1. First-Level Differentiation (Initial Definition of Dimension)|the essence of a differentiated state]] but rather provide **measurements** or **values** that describe the current configuration of that state.
	    **Example**: If a system has the potential to change spatially, then the variable $x$ would be a **quantitative representation** of position along the $x$-axis. 
		    The values of $x$ quantify how much the system has changed within that dimension.

**Variables** represent the **differentiated states within a given dimension** and correspond to what we previously referred to as **third-level differentiation**—the **definition of an instance to a defined constraint within the defined dimension**. 
	At this level of differentiation, we are moving from the **abstract definition** of a dimension and the **introduction of constraints** (via parameters) to the **realization** or **instantiation** of specific **differentiated states**.
		**Variables** are the **quantifiable aspects** of the system that take on specific values **within** a dimension, constrained by the **parameters** and the relational structure previously defined.

**Variables** are the **measured values** or **quantified instances** that describe the system's current state within a given dimension.
	They are the **output** of third-level differentiation, where constraints are applied, and specific instances (or solutions) are realized.
		Variables represent the **outcomes** of differentiation—the quantitative ways in which the system’s potential for variance can be measured. 
			They describe the **specific instances** that emerge from differentiation, representing measurable change within the system.
## Parameters
Parameters represent the **constraints** or **defining conditions** that shape how variables behave. 
	They are the **controllers** or **regulators** of a system’s behavior, setting the **conditions** that the variables must follow.

Parameters are used to **differentiate** by imposing **specific conditions** on how the system can change.
	They act as **boundary markers** that limit and structure the potential variability within a system.

**Parameters** are the **definers** of a differentiated state because they determine **how variables are constrained**. 
	The differentiated state of a system is defined not only by the values of its variables but also by the **configuration of its parameters**, which set the rules for how the variables interact.

**[[AAD Algorithms-Aided Design Parametric Strategies using Grasshopper/AAD/Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Components of Differentiation/Parametrization|Parametrization]]** is the process by which a system's potential is **structured** or **differentiated**.
	It sets up the relational conditions that allow for specific **instances** of the system to emerge, turning the abstract potential of differentiation into a **well-defined state**.
## The Relationship Between Variables and Parameters
### How Parameters Reduce the Degrees of Freedom
Parameters serve as **constraints** that reduce the **degrees of freedom** by limiting the possible values a variable can take or by introducing **relationships** between variables that further restrict their behavior.
	Parameters impose **boundaries** or **conditions** that variables must satisfy, effectively reducing the system's potential for unrestricted change.
#### Mechanism of Reducing Degrees of Freedom via Parameters
The process of **differentiation** and **constraints (implemented by parametrization)** structures the system, progressively refining it from **infinite potential** to specific, **quantified instances** by applying constraints that limit the ways in which the variables can vary, reducing the degrees of freedom at each step.
##### By [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Constraints|Constraining]] a [[AAD Algorithms-Aided Design Parametric Strategies using Grasshopper/AAD/Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Components of Differentiation/Parametrization#Effects of the Configuration of Parameters Relative to Variables|Configuration]] (i.e. Parameters as Definers of Relational Structure/Fixed Relationships)
Parameters define the **relational structure** that variables must adhere to. 
	They describe how **variables interact** with each other or with the system’s underlying framework.
		 The values of parameters serve as **conditions** that shape the system’s behavior, introducing **constraints** that limit the ways in which variables can vary.

Parameters define the **relationship** between variables, such as specifying proportionalities, rates of change, or other structural conditions.
	These relationships reduce the possible values a variable can assume, thus limiting its freedom to vary.
	    **Example**: In the linear equation $y=ax+by$, the parameters $a$ and $b$ fix the **rate of change** (slope) and **position** (intercept) of the variable $y$. 
		    This relationship constrains $y$ to behave in a specific way relative to $x$, reducing the system’s degrees of freedom.
##### By Defining Boundaries (i.e. Parameters as Constraints)
Abstractly, parameters impose **boundaries** or **rules** that govern how the system can differentiate.
	They define the **limits** or **ranges** within which variables can change, serving to **structure** the behavior of the system.
		 **Example**: In a linear system like $y=ax+by$, the parameters $a$ and $b$ control the **slope** and **intercept** of the line, effectively shaping how the variable $y$ changes with respect to $x$. 
			 Here, parameters govern the **relationship** between the variables.
 
Parameters can impose **boundary conditions** or limit the range of possible values a variable can take.
	This confines the variable to a specific **region** or **interval**, eliminating the possibility of infinite variation.
	    **Example**: In the inequality $0\leq x\leq10$, the variable $x$ is constrained to the interval [0,1][0,1] by the parameters defining the lower and upper bounds.
		     This reduces $x$'s degrees of freedom from infinite (without constraints) to a finite range within which it can vary.
##### By Adding Dependencies
When parameters introduce **dependencies** between variables, they reduce the overall **independent degrees of freedom**.
	A system with several variables might initially have a large degree of freedom, but as more parameters are introduced that link variables together (e.g., through constraints or relationships), the number of **independent variables** decreases, reducing the system’s total degrees of freedom.
	    **Example**: In a 3D space, if you constrain the system such that $\LARGE x+y+z=1$, the variables $x$, $y$, and $z$ are no longer fully independent. 
		    One variable (say $z$) can always be determined in terms of $x$ and $y$, reducing the system’s degrees of freedom from 3 to 2.
#### Parametrization and the Reduction of Freedom
**[[AAD Algorithms-Aided Design Parametric Strategies using Grasshopper/AAD/Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Components of Differentiation/Parametrization|Parametrization]]** refers to the process of introducing **parameters** that define the relationships between variables. 
	By parametrizing a system, we effectively **structure** the system’s degrees of freedom, reducing them from infinite or unrestricted possibilities to **specific pathways** or **ranges** within which variables can vary.
###### Examples of Parametrization Reducing Degrees of Freedom
- **Line in 2D**: In a parametric equation for a line, such as:
$$x=tx=t, y=2t+1y=2t+1$$
	The parameter $t$ controls the system, and both $x$ and $y$ are dependent on it. 
		This reduces the degrees of freedom from two (one for $x$ and one for $y$) to **one**, as the parameter $t$ dictates the values of both variables.

- **Ellipse in 2D**: In parametric form, an ellipse can be described as:
$$x=a⋅cos⁡(t),y=b⋅sin⁡(t)x=a⋅cos(t),y=b⋅sin(t)$$
	The parameter $t$ reduces the degrees of freedom by **governing** the values of $x$ and $y$ simultaneously. 
		Here, the variables $x$ and $y$ are no longer free to vary independently but are constrained to follow the elliptical path, where $a$ and $b$ define the axes of the ellipse, and $t$ controls the position along the curve.
##### Effect of Parametrization on Freedom
Parametrization **reduces freedom** by:
- **Constraining variables to follow specific paths** (as in the case of parametric curves like lines, circles, or ellipses).
- **Establishing dependencies** between variables, meaning that the value of one variable directly influences or determines the value of another.
- **Restricting** the range of values a variable can take by imposing relationships that must be satisfied (e.g., equations, inequalities, or conditions).
### Produce Differentiated States
**Differentiated states** are the **instances** of a system that arise when variables are assigned specific values within the constraints imposed by parameters. 
	The differentiated state of a system is defined by the **interaction** between variables and parameters.

**Parameters constrain variables**, leading to the emergence of specific **instances** that satisfy the relational structure defined by those parameters. 
	In this sense, differentiation is the process of **imposing constraints** (through parameters) on **potential variance** (expressed by variables) to produce **distinct, differentiated instances**.
#### Variables as the Realized Solution Sets within a Dimension
In the **third-level differentiation**, variables represent the **realized solutions** within a dimension, based on the **constraints** introduced by parameters.
    The variables are now **bound** by the relationships defined at the second level (e.g., $y=2x+3$.
	    Each variable, such as $x$ or $y$, **quantifies** the system’s behavior, taking on specific **values** that satisfy the constraints.

In this framework, **variables** are the **realized instances** of a system’s potential, representing **differentiated states**within a dimension. 
	They are not merely abstract potential for change but rather the **specific values** that a system takes on after undergoing differentiation and constraint through parameters.
	    **Variables describe the differentiated state** within the system after all constraints have been applied.
		    In this sense, the **value assignment** to a variable is the point at which an **abstract potential** becomes a **concrete instance**.
##### The Set of Instances: Solution Sets
The **outcome** of the process of quantification is the **specific values** or **instances**—the **realized solutions** or **differentiated states** that satisfy the constraints. 
	This is the set of **actualized values** or configurations that result from the imposed constraints and parametrization.

The collection of all possible states (instances) derived from configurations that satisfy the constraints imposed by the parameters within the dimensions.
	Solutions represent the specific states of the system where the parameters take on certain values.

Each solution within a **solution set** is a **specific realization** of the system's potential, constrained by the imposed conditions. 
	In this sense, solutions are the **differentiated instances** themselves, but now they are **realized** within the **constraints** defined by the system.
		The **solution set** doesn’t represent abstract possibilities anymore—it represents the **concrete** outcomes or states that the system can take on given the constraints.

In systems with multiple **constraints**, the solution set represents the **intersection** of all the constraints. 
	These intersections correspond to the **differentiated instances** where all the constraints are satisfied simultaneously.

The **solution set** is essentially the **outcome** of **parametrization** and **constraint**.
	The process of constraining a system with equations or inequalities narrows down the possible differentiated states to a specific set of **solutions**that fit within the defined conditions.
		Each **solution** is a **specific instance** or **differentiated state** that has been realized through the **application of constraints**. 
			These instances represent the system’s possible configurations under the given conditions.
