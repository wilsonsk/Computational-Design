# Fields
Despite the differences in specific definitions, the term "field" in all these contexts shares some common features:
#### Distribution Over a Space
Fields describe values or properties distributed over a space (be it physical space, a set of points, or an abstract space).
	In a mathematical field, the elements are distributed over the set with the operations defined on them.
		In scalar and vector fields, the values (scalars or vectors) are associated with points in a physical or abstract space.
#### Functional Association
A field involves an association or mapping between elements.
	In mathematics, this involves operations on elements within the field.
		In physics and biology, fields map physical quantities (scalars, vectors, or developmental potentials) to points in space.
#### Concept of Influence or Interaction
Fields often represent how values or quantities influence each other across a space.
	In a mathematical field, elements interact through operations.
		In scalar and vector fields, quantities like temperature, pressure, or force influence each point in the space.
			In morphogenetic fields, the potential for development is influenced by the spatial distribution of cells.

### Fields (of Field Theory)
A [[Abstract Mathematical Spaces#Structured Set (i.e. Space)|Structured Set]] with addition and multiplication satisfying certain properties.

In algebra, a **field** is a set equipped with two operations, usually called addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain axioms.
	These are abstract algebraic structures that provide a framework for many areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic geometry, and cryptography.
		This definition comes from field theory, a branch of abstract algebra.
#### Axioms of a Field
A field $F$ is a set with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy the following axioms:
1. **Closure**: For all $\LARGE a, b \in F$, both $\LARGE a+b \text{ and } \cdot b$ are in $\LARGE F$.
2. **Associativity**: Both addition and multiplication are associative.
3. **Commutativity**: Both addition and multiplication are commutative.
4. **Identity Elements**: There exist elements $\LARGE 0 \in F$ and $\LARGE 1 \in F$ such that for all $\LARGE a \in F$, $\LARGE a + 0 = a$ and $\LARGE a \cdot 1 = a$.
5. **Additive Inverses**: For every $\LARGE a \in F$, there exists an element $\LARGE -a \in F$ such that $\LARGE a + (-a) = 0$.
6. **Multiplicative Inverses**: For every $\LARGE a \in F$ (except $0$), there exists an element $a^{-1} \in F$ such that $\LARGE a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$.
7. **Distributivity**: Multiplication

### Fields as [[Mapping|Mappings]] in Analysis and Physics
$$\LARGE f:R^n \to S$$
Where $s$ is the set of possible values .
	(e.g., $\mathbb{R}$ for scalar fields, $\mathbb{R}^m$ for vector fields).
		
A **field** in a spatial context is an abstract mathematical concept used to describe how certain quantities vary over a given spatial domain. 
	A field is a function that assigns a value to every point in a spatial domain, where the domain is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
		This value can be a scalar, vector, or more complex mathematical entity, depending on the type of field.
#### Defining Characteristics
**Spatial Domain**
The domain is a spatial region, meaning each input to the field corresponds to a specific location in space.
	The domain of a field is a spatial region, typically represented as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
		 This means that each point in the domain corresponds to a specific location in $n$-dimensional space.
**Range (i.e. Value Assignment)**
The field maps/assigns a value (scalar, vector, etc.) to each point in the spatial domain.
	The range of a field can vary depending on the type of field:
		For **scalar fields**, the range is $\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers).
		For **vector fields**, the range is typically $\mathbb{R}^m$ (vectors in $m$-dimensional space).
		For more complex fields, the range could be other mathematical structures, such as tensors.
**Continuity**
	In many applications, fields are continuous functions, meaning that small changes in the input (spatial coordinates) result in small changes in the output value.

In the context of analysis, physics, and geometry, a **field** refers to a [[Mapping|function]] that assigns values (scalars, vectors, etc.) to points in a space. 
	- These are functions that provide a way to describe how quantities vary over space and time in physical contexts.
		- They are foundational in fields like fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and general relativity.
			This is quite different from the algebraic definition.
#### Generation of Fields as Mappings
A field as a mapping (whether a scalar field or a vector field) is a specific instance that must be defined explicitly. 
	There is no general field of values mapped to points unless specified by a particular function. 

When a Structured Set (for example, a vector space or a scalar space) is generated, the fields (scalar or vector fields) do not automatically exist. 
	Instead, these fields are defined based on functions that map points within those spaces to scalars or vectors.
