# There is Only Addition
Every operation can be derived back to addition.

## Addition as the Foundation
### Addition
Addition is the fundamental arithmetic operation where quantities are combined. It is the simplest form of arithmetic operation, where two numbers are summed:
$$a+b$$
#### Subtraction as the Inverse of Addition
Subtraction can be understood as the inverse operation of addition. 
	It finds the difference between two quantities by determining what must be added to the subtrahend to reach the minuend:
$$a - b = c \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a = b + c$$
This means that if $c$ is the result of $a - b$, then $a$ is the sum of $b$ and $c$.
#### Multiplication as Repeated Addition
Multiplication is essentially repeated addition. If you multiply a number $a$ by an integer $n$, it means adding $a$ to itself $n$ times:
$$a \times n = \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{n \text{ times}}$$
For example, $3 \times 4$ is the same as adding $3$ four times:
$$3 \times 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12$$
#### Division as Inverse Multiplication (Partitioning)
Division can be viewed as the reverse process of multiplication.
	Instead of combining quantities, division involves partitioning a quantity into equal parts. 
		It finds how many times one number is contained within another, or how a quantity can be evenly distributed:
$$a=b×ca \div b = c \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a = b \times c$$
This means that if $c$ is the result of $a \div b$, then $a$ is the product of $b$ and $c$.

Division can also be thought of as multiplication by the reciprocal:

### Abstract Understanding
To abstractly understand how every operation can be derived back to addition:
1. **Addition:**
    - The basic operation of combining two quantities.
        $$a + b$$
2. **Subtraction:**
    - The inverse of addition, finding the quantity that when added to the subtrahend results in the minuend.
        $$a - b = c \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a = b + c$$
3. **Multiplication:**
    - Repeated addition of the same quantity.
        $$a \times n = \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{n \text{ times}}$$
4. **Division:**
    - Partitioning a quantity into equal parts, or the inverse of multiplication.
        $$a \div b = c \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a = b \times c$$
    - Alternatively, multiplying by the reciprocal.
        $$a \div b = a \times \frac{1}{b}$$
### Understanding Division as Contraction
To understand how addition can be considered the foundation of division, it's helpful to start by thinking about how multiplication and division are built on the concepts of repeated addition and partitioning, respectively.
1. **Addition:**
    - Addition is the process of combining quantities. For example, if you have two numbers, $a$ and $b$, their sum is written as:
        $$a + b$$
2. **Repeated Addition (Multiplication):**
    - Multiplication is essentially repeated addition. If you multiply a number $a$ by an integer $n$, it means adding $a$ to itself $n$ times:
        $$a \times n = \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{n \text{ times}}$$
#### Concept of Division
Division can be viewed as the reverse process of multiplication. Instead of combining quantities, division involves partitioning a quantity into equal parts.
1. **Division as Partitioning:**
    - Division is the process of distributing a total quantity into a certain number of equal parts. If you have a number $a$ and you want to divide it by $b$, you are essentially finding how many times $b$ can be added to itself to equal $a$:
        $$a \div b = c \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a = b \times c$$
#### Deriving Division from Addition
Let's derive the concept of division from the idea of repeated addition:
1. **Understanding Multiplication via Repeated Addition:**
    - Consider the equation:
        $$a = b \times c$$
    - This means that $a$ is the result of adding $b$ to itself $c$ times:
        $$a = \underbrace{b + b + \cdots + b}_{c \text{ times}}$$
2. **Inverting the Process (Division):**
    - To find $c$, given $a$ and $b$, we need to determine how many times $b$ can be added to itself to reach $a$. This is the essence of division:
        $$c = \frac{a}{b}$$
3. **Visualization:**
    - Imagine you have a total quantity $a$ and you want to distribute it into $b$ equal parts. Each part will contain:
	$$\frac{a}{b}$$
#### Division as Repeated Addition of an Inverse
Given the division $a \div b$, this can be understood as multiplying $a$ by the reciprocal of $b$:
$$a \div b = a \times \frac{1}{b}$$

To understand this through repeated addition, let's break it down step-by-step.
### Example
Consider $a = 12$ and $b = 4$. We want to find $12 \div 4$.
1. **Division Using Multiplicative Inverse:** $$12 \div 4 = 12 \times \frac{1}{4}$$​

1. **Reciprocal of 4:** $$\frac{1}{4}$$

1. **Multiplication as Repeated Addition of the Reciprocal:**
    - Multiplying 12 by $\frac{1}{4}$ means adding $\frac{1}{4}$ to itself 12 times.
    - The product of $12 \times \frac{1}{4}$ is the sum of $\frac{1}{4}$ added 12 times:
        $$12 \times \frac{1}{4} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{4}}_{12 \text{ times}}$$
	
1. **Summing the Fractions:**
    - Each time you add $\frac{1}{4}$, it represents a part of the whole. Doing this 12 times gives:
        $$\underbrace{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{4}}_{12 \text{ times}} = \frac{12}{4} = 3$$
### General Form
For any numbers $a$ and $b$, where $b \neq 0$, division $a \div b$ can be expressed as:
1. **Division Using Multiplicative Inverse:**
    $$a \div b = a \times \frac{1}{b}$$
2. **Multiplication as Repeated Addition of the Reciprocal:**
    - Multiplying $a$ by $\frac{1}{b}$ means adding $\frac{1}{b}$ to itself $a$ times.
    - The product $a \times \frac{1}{b}$ is the sum of $\frac{1}{b}$ added $a$ times:
        $$a \times \frac{1}{b} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{b} + \cdots + \frac{1}{b}}_{a \text{ times}}$$
3. **Summing the Fractions:**
    - Each time you add $\frac{1}{b}$, it represents a part of the whole. Doing this $a$ times gives:
        $$\underbrace{\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{b} + \cdots + \frac{1}{b}}_{a \text{ times}} = \frac{a}{b}$$
#### Concrete Example
Consider $a = 12$ and $b = 3$:
1. **Multiplication:**
    $$3 \times 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12$$
2. **Division:**
    $$\frac{12}{3} = 4$$
3. **Inverse Approach:**
    - The inverse of $3$ is $\frac{1}{3}$:
        $$12 \div 3 = 12 \times \frac{1}{3}$$
4. **Multiplication as Repeated Addition:**
    - Multiplying $12$ by $\frac{1}{3}$ means adding $12$ to itself $\frac{1}{3}$ times, or equivalently partitioning $12$ into 3 equal parts:
        $$12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4$$
### Abstract Understanding
To abstractly understand what it means for a variable $a$ to be "divided into parts":
1. **Multiplication as Repeated Addition:**
    - Multiplication $a \times n$ can be seen as adding $a$ to itself $n$ times.
2. **Division as Finding the Number of Additions:**
    - Division $a \div b$ is finding the number $c$ such that adding $b$ to itself $c$ times equals $a$.
3. **Formally:**
    $$\text{If } a = b \times c, \text{ then } c = \frac{a}{b}.$$
### Summary
- **Addition as Foundation:** Addition is the fundamental operation where quantities are combined.
- **Multiplication as Repeated Addition:** Multiplication is repeated addition.
- **Division as Multiplication by Inverse:** Division by a number $b$ is the same as multiplying by its inverse $\frac{1}{b}$.
- **Partitioning through Division:** Division can be thought of as partitioning a total quantity into equal parts, using the inverse to determine the size of each part.
By understanding these relationships, you can see how addition serves as the foundation for both multiplication and division, with division involving the concept of the inverse to distribute a total quantity into equal parts.
