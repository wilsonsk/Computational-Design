# Ratio
A ratio is a mathematical expression that compares two quantities, showing the relative size of one quantity in relation to the other.
	It is often expressed as a fraction or a division of two quantities.
## From Ratio to Rate of Change
$$\LARGE \text{Ratio } = \frac{a}{b}$$
A ratio is not necessarily the same as a rate.
	A ratio is a comparison of two quantities that shows how many times one value contains or is contained within the other. 
		It is **a dimensionless quantity**, meaning it does not have units.
			It is a general comparison between two quantities.
## Rate (of change)
$$\LARGE \text{Rate } = \frac{\Delta \text{Quantity }1}{\Delta \text{Quantity } 2}$$
A rate is a specific type of ratio that involves different units and measures how one quantity changes in relation to another.
	Rates include different units in the numerator and denominator, which inherently imply a relationship involving change. 
		Units inherently imply a relationship involving change.

A Rate is a specific comparison that measures how one quantity **changes** with respect to another (i.e. where one quantity is dependent on or varies with another) over a period or in a specific context.
	It implies change because it describes the relationship between two different quantities that typically vary.

Here, the implicit interval is the time period of 2 hours, but we don't usually refer to it explicitly as an "interval."
## Average Rate (of change)
$$\LARGE \text{Given an interval } [x_1, x_2]$$
$$\LARGE \text{Average Rate of Change } = \frac{(f(x_2) - f(x_1))}{x_2 - x_1}$$
The average rate of change of a function over a given interval is the ratio of the total change in the function's value to the total change in the input value over that interval.
	It represents the overall rate of change over the interval.
		This is done by calculating the ratio of the difference in the function's values at the endpoints of the interval to the difference in the input values.

Therefore, a defined interval () is required to calculate the average rate of change. 
	The average rate of change measures how a function's value changes, on average, over a specific interval. 
		Without a defined interval, it is impossible to determine the starting and ending points needed to compute the average change.
		
The interval is in relation to both quantities involved in calculating the average rate of change.
	Specifically, the interval defines the range of the independent variable (input), and the corresponding changes in the dependent variable (output) are measured over this interval.

The Average Rate of Change is a Linear Function, represented by the [[Secant Line#The Average Rate of Change|Slope of the Secant Line]].
## Instantaneous Rate (of change)
$$\LARGE f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$
The instantaneous rate of change is the rate at which a function is changing at a specific point.
	It is the limit of the average rate of change as the interval approaches zero.
		This is also known as the derivative of the function at a given point.

The Instantaneous Rate of Change is represented by the [[Tangent Line#The Slope of a Secant Line|Slope of the Tangent Line]].

## Ratio as a Fraction
When used as a fraction, it shows a part-to-whole relationship.
- **Whole**: 10 parts.
- **Fraction**: $\frac{5}{10}$​, meaning 5 out of 10 parts, simplifying to $\frac{1}{2}$​.
### Fraction
A fraction represents a part of a whole. 
	It is a way to describe how many parts of a certain size are needed to make up a whole.

Mathematically, if $0 < b < a$, then $b$ is a proper fraction of $a$, meaning $b$ represents a part of $a$.
	When $b$ is smaller than $a$, we can consider $b$ as a fraction of $a$.

## A Ratio as a Scalar
When we talk about contraction in the context of scaling with a scalar less than 1, we mean that we are effectively reducing the original quantity. 
$$\LARGE \text{If } \space b = a$$
$$\LARGE \text{then } \frac{a}{b} = 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{If } \space b = 1 \space \text{then } \frac{a}{b} = a$$
### Contracting to Make a Quantity, or Value, Smaller
Via contracting some constant as a scalar.
$$\LARGE \text{If }a < b$$
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} = \text{a fraction (of b) that is } < 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{So, if } a < b \text{ then } a \text{ is a "part" (i.e. a fraction) of } b$$
$$\LARGE \text{Meaning b is no longer a whole number, } \frac{b}{b}$$
$$\LARGE \text{But that b is a fraction of itself,} \frac{a}{b}$$
$$\LARGE \text{The quantity a is a fraction of b.}$$
$$\LARGE \text{This means a represents a part of the whole b.}$$
### [[Scaling|Scaling]] to Make a Quantity, or Value, Larger
$$\LARGE \text{If }a > b$$
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} > 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{Therefore, } \frac{a}{b} \text{ becomes a Scalar}$$
$$\LARGE \text{So, if } a > b \text{ then } b \text{ is a "part" (i.e. a fraction) of } a$$
$$ \text{I.e. a can be divided into parts of size b, but the number of parts may not be a whole number if a is not an exact multiple of b.}$$
##### Think About It...
If $b$ is smaller than $1$, it itself becomes a fraction.
	The ratio becomes, "how many of these small "pieces" can fit evenly into this larger number?"
$$\LARGE \frac{10}{0.1} = 100$$
$$\LARGE \text{This Ratio asks, "how many } 0.1 \text{'s (i.e. } \frac{1}{10}'s) \text{ fit evenly into 10?}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And the Answer is that 100, 0.1's can fit into 10.}$$
$$\LARGE \frac{0.1}{10} = 0.01$$
$$\LARGE \text{This Ratio asks, "how many } 10 \text{'s (i.e. } \frac{10}{1}'s) \text{ fit evenly into 0.1?}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And the Answer is that only a fraction of 10 (i.e. 0.01) can fit into 0.1.}$$
This is why dividing by a fraction is actually
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{(\frac{1}{b})} == a \cdot \frac{b}{1}$$
$$\LARGE \text{Therefore, }\frac{1}{b} \text{ in functioning as } \frac{b}{1} \text{, itself becomes a Scalar}$$

## Division Perspective
When used in division, it shows how a quantity is subdivided into smaller equal parts.
- **Total Quantity**: 5 units.
- **Groups**: 10 groups.
- **Result**: Each group gets $\frac{5}{10}$ ​=0.5 units.
### Simultaneous Interpretation with an Example
Imagine you have a scenario that involves both perspectives:
- You have 5 liters of water.
- You have 10 containers to fill.
Using the ratio $\LARGE \frac{5}{10}$​:
1. **Fraction Perspective**:
    - You are considering the water as a fraction of the total capacity if each container can hold 1 liter.
    - The water you have (5 liters) is $\frac{5}{10}$​ of the total capacity needed to fill all containers (10 liters).
2. **Division Perspective**:
    - You divide 5 liters of water into 10 containers.
    - Each container gets $\frac{5}{10} ​=0.5$ liters of water.
