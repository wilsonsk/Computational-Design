# Ratio
### 2. **Ratio as a _Parameter_**

Here’s where things get interesting: when you think of a ratio as a parameter, you’re elevating it from being a mere "result" of a division to something _active_, like a dial you can tune. This "dial" adjusts the relationship between two values. If you think about different systems where a parameter defines behavior — like in physics with constants of proportionality (e.g., Hooke’s Law, F=kxF = kxF=kx) or even in financial models (where interest rates define growth) — the parameter acts like a rule that defines the relationship's intensity, but it doesn’t act independently. It only exists _because_ of the relationship between xxx and yyy.

Think of this: mmm, the parameter, is like a bridge that adjusts how two quantities are connected. This isn’t just passive. It governs how tightly or loosely these quantities are linked, creating a direct cause-effect channel between them. It turns two independent scalars into a _system_.

### 3. **Division as a Binding Relationship**

What if, instead of thinking of division merely as an operation, you thought of it as a **relationship-generating process**? Division (or a ratio) introduces a _dynamic relationship_ between the two values. In essence, the ratio becomes a **lens** through which you see how one variable scales or changes relative to the other. It is an abstraction that compresses the interaction between two entities into a single value — like a snapshot of their relationship at a given moment.

Take a more abstract example. Let’s say you have two abstract entities in a geometric space, say a point at (x1,y1)(x_1, y_1)(x1​,y1​) and another at (x2,y2)(x_2, y_2)(x2​,y2​). The "division" or ratio between their coordinates isn’t just a mathematical result but defines **a gradient**, a direction or slope that describes how one point changes relative to the other in the space. This parameter (like a slope) now becomes a _directive_, telling you how the two points relate not just spatially, but _relationally_.

### 4. **The Ratio as a _Link_ Between Two Realms**

Here’s an analogy that might give you that "aha" moment:

Imagine you’re standing between two worlds. On one side, you have xxx (one scalar), and on the other side, you have yyy (another scalar). The ratio, mmm, is like a portal or _thread_ connecting them. It governs the flow of energy, influence, or change between these two worlds. If mmm is large, then a small change in xxx causes a large change in yyy. If mmm is small, the connection between the two worlds is more subtle, and changes in one world only slightly affect the other. In this way, mmm is more than just a constant — it’s the _fabric_ that ties these two different quantities together.

### 5. **Ratios as Dimensions of Change**

In physics, ratios often represent fundamental constants that govern how quantities interact. For instance, velocity is a ratio of distance over time. But here’s the insight: that ratio is also the parameter that _links_ the concept of motion through space and time. You can’t have velocity without both distance and time, but velocity _itself_ isn't either of those things. It’s a higher-level descriptor, a **relational dimension** that arises _only because_ distance and time are in conversation with each other.

When you think about it this way, the ratio becomes a _new dimension_ in which the two quantities can interact. It’s a rule that they follow, a constraint they obey. And that’s why it’s so powerful.

### 6. **Ratios in Parametric Design**

Lastly, if we extend this thinking to parametric design, the ratio is **the very essence of parametric control**. When designing forms or spaces, ratios between dimensions (length, width, height) don’t just define the shape, they _bind_ its elements together. Change one parameter, and the whole form adapts — the ratio here is more than a static measurement; it becomes the **generator** of relationships that create dynamic, evolving systems.

### 1. **What is a Parameter?**

In the most general sense, a **parameter** is a variable that defines a system or influences the behavior of a system but isn't necessarily one of the primary variables being studied. It’s something you can adjust, and it will change the behavior or outcome of the system. Parameters are like the "settings" you can tweak in a model.

For example, in the equation y=mxy = mxy=mx, mmm is a parameter because it controls the relationship between xxx and yyy. If you change mmm, you change how yyy responds to changes in xxx, but you don’t necessarily change xxx or yyy directly. You are adjusting the way those two variables are connected.

### 2. **The Dependency of the Parameter**

Here’s the key thing that’s confusing you (and it’s subtle): you’re absolutely right that the parameter mmm is often _derived_ from the relationship between xxx and yyy. In that sense, it’s **dependent** on xxx and yyy. If you rearrange the equation y=mxy = mxy=mx, you get:

m=yxm = \frac{y}{x}m=xy​

So, mmm is indeed determined by the values of yyy and xxx. This makes it feel like mmm is not an independent player in the equation but more of a result of their interaction.

However, in the context of how we usually talk about parameters in equations, **once** mmm is defined, it becomes a **fixed relationship** that governs how yyy and xxx relate. In other words, while you can use xxx and yyy to _calculate_ mmm, you can also think of mmm as the thing that describes _how_ yyy will scale with xxx, or vice versa.

### 3. **Why Parameters Still Matter**

Think of parameters as part of a _model_. Once you know mmm, it acts as a _constant_ that controls the relationship between xxx and yyy. It no longer fluctuates as xxx or yyy changes (unless you explicitly change mmm). So while mmm was **derived** from xxx and yyy, it now acts as a governing rule between them. This is why parameters like mmm are still considered critical in systems — they dictate behavior even though their value may come from the relationship between other variables.

### 4. **Parameters vs. Descriptive Relationships**

Now, you raised a great point: mmm might feel more like a **descriptive relationship** rather than a true "independent" parameter. This is because it’s describing how xxx and yyy relate in that specific scenario. However, in many systems, parameters work exactly like this. They describe a fixed relationship between variables, and their **role** is to set the structure of how those variables interact.

It might help to look at a different example:

In a physics equation like Hooke’s Law:

F=kxF = kxF=kx

Here, kkk is a **parameter** that describes the stiffness of a spring. Once we know the value of kkk, it _binds_ FFF and xxx together. Yes, you could calculate kkk if you know FFF and xxx, but once you _have_ kkk, it doesn’t change unless you move to a different spring. kkk is now governing the relationship between the force and the displacement, even though it was derived from an initial situation.

### 5. **Understanding Parameters as Governing Relationships**

So, mmm in your example represents a **fixed rule** or **constant of proportionality** once it’s defined, even though it might have been calculated from yyy and xxx. The key is that after it’s defined, it doesn’t _change_ unless you explicitly adjust it. It governs how changes in one variable (say xxx) will produce changes in the other variable (say yyy).

This makes mmm a **parameter** because it still _controls_ the relationship between xxx and yyy. It’s as if you’ve set a rule that binds the two variables together, and that rule is mmm.

### 6. **The Core Idea**

A **parameter** is not about being independent or primary, but rather about defining a **relationship** or **structure** in a system. In your example, mmm (the quotient of y/xy/xy/x) is a parameter because it determines how xxx and yyy will behave relative to each other. While it is derived from them, it’s now acting as the _rule_ by which xxx and yyy relate.

**The big takeaway**: Parameters are more about _controlling the structure of the relationship_ than being completely independent. Even though mmm depends on xxx and yyy, once defined, it governs how those two variables will always interact, hence acting as a parameter.

### Analogy to Simplify:

Imagine two dancers ( xxx and yyy ) moving across the floor. The ratio mmm is like the rhythm or beat to which they’re dancing. It controls how they move relative to each other. The rhythm ( mmm) can be discovered by watching the dancers (observing xxx and yyy), but once you know it, it defines how they’ll continue to move together. The rhythm is a _parameter_ of their dance — it controls their relationship, even though it was initially inferred from their movement.

A ratio is a mathematical expression that compares two quantities, showing the relative size of one quantity in relation to the other.
	It is often expressed as a fraction or a division of two quantities.
## From Ratio to Rate of Change
$$\LARGE \text{Ratio } = \frac{a}{b}$$
A ratio is not necessarily the same as a rate.
	A ratio is a comparison of two quantities that shows how many times one value contains or is contained within the other. 
		It is **a dimensionless quantity**, meaning it does not have units.
			It is a general comparison between two quantities.
## Rate (of change)
$$\LARGE \text{Rate } = \frac{\Delta \text{Quantity }1}{\Delta \text{Quantity } 2}$$
A rate is a specific type of ratio that involves different units and measures how one quantity changes in relation to another.
	Rates include different units in the numerator and denominator, which inherently imply a relationship involving change. 
		Units inherently imply a relationship involving change.

A Rate is a specific comparison that measures how one quantity **changes** with respect to another (i.e. where one quantity is dependent on or varies with another) over a period or in a specific context.
	It implies change because it describes the relationship between two different quantities that typically vary.

Here, the implicit interval is the time period of 2 hours, but we don't usually refer to it explicitly as an "interval."
## Average Rate (of change)
$$\LARGE \text{Given an interval } [x_1, x_2]$$
$$\LARGE \text{Average Rate of Change } = \frac{(f(x_2) - f(x_1))}{x_2 - x_1}$$
The average rate of change of a function over a given interval is the ratio of the total change in the function's value to the total change in the input value over that interval.
	It represents the overall rate of change over the interval.
		This is done by calculating the ratio of the difference in the function's values at the endpoints of the interval to the difference in the input values.

Therefore, a defined interval () is required to calculate the average rate of change. 
	The average rate of change measures how a function's value changes, on average, over a specific interval. 
		Without a defined interval, it is impossible to determine the starting and ending points needed to compute the average change.
		
The interval is in relation to both quantities involved in calculating the average rate of change.
	Specifically, the interval defines the range of the independent variable (input), and the corresponding changes in the dependent variable (output) are measured over this interval.

The Average Rate of Change is a Linear Function, represented by the [[Secant Line#The Average Rate of Change|Slope of the Secant Line]].
## Instantaneous Rate (of change)
$$\LARGE f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$
The instantaneous rate of change is the rate at which a function is changing at a specific point.
	It is the limit of the average rate of change as the interval approaches zero.
		This is also known as the derivative of the function at a given point.

The Instantaneous Rate of Change is represented by the [[Tangent Line#The Slope of a Secant Line|Slope of the Tangent Line]].

## Ratio as a Fraction
When used as a fraction, it shows a part-to-whole relationship.
- **Whole**: 10 parts.
- **Fraction**: $\frac{5}{10}$​, meaning 5 out of 10 parts, simplifying to $\frac{1}{2}$​.
### Fraction
A fraction represents a part of a whole. 
	It is a way to describe how many parts of a certain size are needed to make up a whole.

Mathematically, if $0 < b < a$, then $b$ is a proper fraction of $a$, meaning $b$ represents a part of $a$.
	When $b$ is smaller than $a$, we can consider $b$ as a fraction of $a$.

## A Ratio as a Scalar
When we talk about contraction in the context of scaling with a scalar less than 1, we mean that we are effectively reducing the original quantity. 
$$\LARGE \text{If } \space b = a$$
$$\LARGE \text{then } \frac{a}{b} = 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{If } \space b = 1 \space \text{then } \frac{a}{b} = a$$
### Contracting to Make a Quantity, or Value, Smaller
Via contracting some constant as a scalar.
$$\LARGE \text{If }a < b$$
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} = \text{a fraction (of b) that is } < 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{So, if } a < b \text{ then } a \text{ is a "part" (i.e. a fraction) of } b$$
$$\LARGE \text{Meaning b is no longer a whole number, } \frac{b}{b}$$
$$\LARGE \text{But that b is a fraction of itself,} \frac{a}{b}$$
$$\LARGE \text{The quantity a is a fraction of b.}$$
$$\LARGE \text{This means a represents a part of the whole b.}$$
### [[Scaling|Scaling]] to Make a Quantity, or Value, Larger
$$\LARGE \text{If }a > b$$
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} > 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{Therefore, } \frac{a}{b} \text{ becomes a Scalar}$$
$$\LARGE \text{So, if } a > b \text{ then } b \text{ is a "part" (i.e. a fraction) of } a$$
$$ \text{I.e. a can be divided into parts of size b, but the number of parts may not be a whole number if a is not an exact multiple of b.}$$
##### Think About It...
If $b$ is smaller than $1$, it itself becomes a fraction.
	The ratio becomes, "how many of these small "pieces" can fit evenly into this larger number?"
$$\LARGE \frac{10}{0.1} = 100$$
$$\LARGE \text{This Ratio asks, "how many } 0.1 \text{'s (i.e. } \frac{1}{10}'s) \text{ fit evenly into 10?}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And the Answer is that 100, 0.1's can fit into 10.}$$
$$\LARGE \frac{0.1}{10} = 0.01$$
$$\LARGE \text{This Ratio asks, "how many } 10 \text{'s (i.e. } \frac{10}{1}'s) \text{ fit evenly into 0.1?}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And the Answer is that only a fraction of 10 (i.e. 0.01) can fit into 0.1.}$$
This is why dividing by a fraction is actually
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{(\frac{1}{b})} == a \cdot \frac{b}{1}$$
$$\LARGE \text{Therefore, }\frac{1}{b} \text{ in functioning as } \frac{b}{1} \text{, itself becomes a Scalar}$$

## Division Perspective
When used in division, it shows how a quantity is subdivided into smaller equal parts.
- **Total Quantity**: 5 units.
- **Groups**: 10 groups.
- **Result**: Each group gets $\frac{5}{10}$ ​=0.5 units.
### Simultaneous Interpretation with an Example
Imagine you have a scenario that involves both perspectives:
- You have 5 liters of water.
- You have 10 containers to fill.
Using the ratio $\LARGE \frac{5}{10}$​:
1. **Fraction Perspective**:
    - You are considering the water as a fraction of the total capacity if each container can hold 1 liter.
    - The water you have (5 liters) is $\frac{5}{10}$​ of the total capacity needed to fill all containers (10 liters).
2. **Division Perspective**:
    - You divide 5 liters of water into 10 containers.
    - Each container gets $\frac{5}{10} ​=0.5$ liters of water.
