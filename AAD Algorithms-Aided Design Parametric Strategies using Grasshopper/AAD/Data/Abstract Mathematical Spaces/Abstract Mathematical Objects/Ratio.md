# Ratio
A ratio is a mathematical expression that compares two quantities, showing the relative size of one quantity in relation to the other.
	It is often expressed as a fraction or a division of two quantities.

## Fraction Perspective
When used as a fraction, it shows a part-to-whole relationship.
- **Whole**: 10 parts.
- **Fraction**: $\frac{5}{10}$​, meaning 5 out of 10 parts, simplifying to $\frac{1}{2}$​.
## Division Perspective
When used in division, it shows how a quantity is subdivided into smaller equal parts.
- **Total Quantity**: 5 units.
- **Groups**: 10 groups.
- **Result**: Each group gets $\frac{5}{10}$ ​=0.5 units.
### Simultaneous Interpretation with an Example
Imagine you have a scenario that involves both perspectives:
- You have 5 liters of water.
- You have 10 containers to fill.
Using the ratio $\LARGE \frac{5}{10}$​:
1. **Fraction Perspective**:
    - You are considering the water as a fraction of the total capacity if each container can hold 1 liter.
    - The water you have (5 liters) is $\frac{5}{10}$​ of the total capacity needed to fill all containers (10 liters).
2. **Division Perspective**:
    - You divide 5 liters of water into 10 containers.
    - Each container gets $\frac{5}{10} ​=0.5$ liters of water.
