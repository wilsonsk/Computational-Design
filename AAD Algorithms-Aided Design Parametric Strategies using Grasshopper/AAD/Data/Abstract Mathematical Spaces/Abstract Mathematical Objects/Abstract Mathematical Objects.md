# Abstract Mathematical Objects
## Mathematical objects are what we talk and write about when we do math.
I.e. Model the Subject Under Study

How we [[Language|talk]] about math objects show how we _think_ about them.

The **behaviors** and **interactions** between them are defined by and exist within an abstract, non-physical space as elements of the [[Analysis#Underlying Set (i.e. Base Set)|underlying set]].
## Abstract Mathematical Objects are Defined by Properties and Relations
These objects are often characterized more by the relationships they have with other objects and the properties they possess rather than any physical attributes.

They are conceptual entities defined within the framework of mathematical logic and theory, independent of any physical realization.
	These objects are used to model, represent, or describe properties, quantities, or relationships in both pure mathematics and applied sciences.
	
Abstract Mathematical Objects are theoretical constructs that exist in the realm of ideas and mathematical theories. 
	They are not tangible but can be defined by sets of rules or properties in a mathematical system. 
	These objects serve as the fundamental entities with which mathematicians and scientists work to formulate theories, prove theorems, and model various types of physical and abstract systems.
	Their abstract nature means they can be universally applied across different areas of study, making them indispensable tools in the scientific exploration of the universe.

Abstract Mathematical Objects are used at all scales.
	But the objects vary at a given.
