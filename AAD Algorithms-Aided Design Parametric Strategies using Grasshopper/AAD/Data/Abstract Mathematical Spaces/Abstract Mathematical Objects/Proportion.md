# Proportion
## Is a Relationship (i.e. a Ratio or a Rate) Between Quantities
A proportion is a statement that two [[Division#Ratio|ratios]] are equal. 
	It indicates that two pairs of quantities have the same relative size or the same ratio.
	
In a general sense, proportion can also refer to the relationship between two quantities where one quantity is a **[[#The Constant of Proportionality|constant multiple]]** of the other.

A proportional relationship exists when two quantities vary directly with each other. 
	If one quantity is multiplied by a constant, the other quantity is also multiplied by the same constant.

##### Types of Proportion
###### Linear Proportion (the "Strict" Definition of Proportion)
A "proportion" typically refers to a linear relationship between two variables where one variable is a constant multiple of the other.
	This is expressed as the constant of proportionality, $k$. 
		I.e. $k = \frac{y}{x}$ is **constant ratio** and is also a **constant factor**, $y=kx$.
###### Non-Linear Relationships (i.e. Lenient Definition of Proportion)
Relationships can also be Non-Linear, thought not strictly "proportional".
	These relationships are described by functions that dictate how one variable changes with respect to another. 
		The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$​ is not constant, but there may still be a consistent relationship defined by the function.

## Components of Proportion
#### [[Ratio|Ratios]]
A ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. 
	$$\LARGE \text{The ratio } \frac{a}{b} \text{ compares } a \text{ to } b.$$
#### Equality of Ratios
When two ratios are equal, it implies that the relationship between the first pair of numbers is the same as the relationship between the second pair. 
	For instance, 
	$$\LARGE \text{If } \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$​$$\LARGE \text{Then } a \text{ relates to } b \text{ in the same way that } c \text{ relates to } d$$
	$$\LARGE = a\cdot d = b \cdot c$$
	$$\LARGE \text{This can be thought of as } y = ad \text{ and } kx = bc \text{ therefore, } k = \frac{bc}{x}$$
	$$\LARGE \text{Remember that } ad = bc \text{ therefore, } y = bc \text{ thus } k = \frac{y}{x}$$
	$$\LARGE \text{Where } k \text{ is the Constant of Proportionality.}$$
#### Constant
A value that does not change. 
	It remains fixed and unaltered regardless of the variables in the equation or the changes in the context in which it is used.
##### Properties of a Constant
###### Fixed Value
A constant has a specific, unchanging value. 
	For example, in the equation $y=kx$, $k$ is a constant.
###### Independent of Variables
The value of a constant does not depend on any variables.
	It remains the same no matter what the variables are or how they change.

### *Aside: Why Quadratic, Cubic, etc. Relationships Are Not Constant*
Quadratic, cubic, and higher-order polynomial relationships are not constant because they involve variables that change in a non-linear way. 
	The values of these expressions depend on the variables raised to different powers, which results in varying outputs as the variables change.
		I.e. This results in non-constant outputs for $y$ as $x$ changes.
#### Why
###### Changing Ratio
The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$​ varies as $x$ changes because the relationship involves variables raised to a power (e.g., $x^2$, $x^3$). 
	This results in non-constant outputs for $y$ as $x$ changes.
###### Function-Based Relationship
While there might be a constant within the function (e.g., $k$ in $y = kx^2$), this does not equate to a constant ratio between $y$ and $x$.
	The non-linear nature means that the output $y$ does not change proportionally with $x$.
#### Quadratic Relationships
A **quadratic relationship** is represented by an equation of the form:
$$\LARGE y = ax^2 + bx + c$$
Where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.
###### Non-linearity
The term $ax^2$ means that for different values of $x$, the change in $y$ is not constant but varies with the square of $x$.
	The relationship is non-linear because $y$ does not change at a constant rate with respect to $x$.
###### Constant *Relationship*
The term $ax^2$ means the output $y$ is proportional to the **square** of $x$, resulting in a parabolic curve when graphed.
$$\LARGE k = \frac{y}{x^2}$$
	The output $y$ is proportional to the ***square*** of $x$ (the term $x^2$).
		$k$ can be seen as a constant within the context of $y=kx^2$, but it does not imply a constant ratio $\frac{y}{x}$.

But not in the sense of a constant ration, $\frac{y}{x}$.
$$\LARGE k \neq \frac{y}{x}$$
#### Cubic Relationships
A **cubic relationship** is represented by an equation of the form:
$$\LARGE y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$$
Where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are constants.
###### Higher-order Non-linearity
The term $ax^3$ means that the change in $y$ varies with the **cube** of $x$, making the relationship even more complex and variable than a quadratic relationship.
###### Constant Relationship
The term $ax^3$ means the output $y$ is proportional to the **cube** of $x$, resulting in an S-shaped curve when graphed.
$$\LARGE k = \frac{y}{x^3}$$
	The output $y$ is proportional to the ***cube*** of $x$ (the term $x^3$).
		$k$ can be seen as a constant within the context of $y=kx^3$, but it does not imply a constant ratio $\frac{y}{x}$.

But not in the sense of a constant ration, $\frac{y}{x}$.
$$\LARGE k \neq \frac{y}{x}$$
#### Characteristics of Non-Constant Relationships
###### Variable Output
The output value $y$ changes in a non-linear manner as the input value $x$ changes.
###### Dependence on Higher Powers of Variables
The presence of terms like $x^2$, $x^3$, etc., means the rate of change of $y$ depends on the higher powers of $x$.
###### Curved Graphs
When graphed, quadratic and cubic relationships produce curves rather than straight lines, indicating the varying rate of change.

## Proportionality and Relationships
Proportionality is a mathematical concept that describes a specific type of relationship between two quantities, where the ratio of the two quantities remains constant.

Proportionality means that two quantities vary directly with each other.
	If one quantity is multiplied by a constant factor, the other quantity is also multiplied by the same factor.
### The Constant of Proportionality 
Is a fixed value that relates two variables that are directly proportional to each other.
	It is the constant factor by which one variable is multiplied to obtain the other variable. 
		In a proportional relationship, this constant remains the same, no matter what values the variables take.
##### The Constant of Proportionality as a Constant Factor
$$\LARGE y = kx$$
##### The Constant of Proportionality, $k$ as a Ratio Itself 
$$\LARGE \frac{y}{x} = \frac{c}{d}$$
$$\LARGE k = \frac{c}{d}$$
$$\LARGE \frac{y}{x} = k$$
The constant of proportionality $k$ is a crucial concept in understanding linear relationships between variables. 
	It defines the rate at which one variable changes in relation to another, ensuring that the ratio between the variables remains consistent. 
		This concept is widely used in various fields, including physics, economics, and everyday scenarios, to describe relationships where quantities vary directly with each other.

If two variables $x$ and $y$ are directly proportional, the relationship can be expressed as: 
$$\LARGE y=kx$$
- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $x$ is the independent variable.
- $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
### Linear Proportional Relationships (i.e. Direct Proportion)
Two quantities $x$ and $y$ are directly proportional if they change at the same rate, and this relationship can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE y = kx$$
Here, $k$ is a constant of proportionality, and $y$ is directly proportional to $x$.
$$\LARGE k = {y}{x} \text{ is a Constant }$$
##### Why the Constant of Proportionality Equates to Linearity
The constant of proportionality ($k$) in the direct variation equation $y=kx$ equates to linearity because:
###### Slope Interpretation
The constant $k$ is the slope of the line.
	In the equation $y=kx$, $k$ determines how steep the line is.
		 A higher value of $k$ means the line rises more steeply.
###### Linearity Requirement
Any linear relationship involves a constant rate of change, represented by the slope.
	When $k$ is the slope in direct variation, the relationship is linear by definition, as it describes a straight-line relationship between $y$ and $x$.
##### Properties of the Constant of Proportionality (and thus of Proportional Relationships)
###### Fixed Ratio
The constant of proportionality represents a fixed ratio between the variables $y$ and $x$. 
	In a proportional relationship, $\frac{y}{x} = k$.
		 This means that for any values of $x$ and $y$, the ratio remains constant, signifying a direct proportional relationship.
$$\LARGE k=yx$$
###### Linearity
Refers to a relationship between two variables that forms a straight line when graphed. 
	A proportional relationship is always linear, as depicted by the equation $y=kx$.
		 When graphed, this relationship forms a straight line passing through the origin (0,0). 
			 The slope of this line is $k$, indicating the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ (i.e. as $x$ also changes).
			 
This relationship can be represented by a linear equation of the form:
$$\LARGE y = mx + b$$
In the equation $y=mx+b$, $x$ determines the slope of the line when the relationship is graphed on a coordinate plane.
###### Direct Variation
Is a specific type of linear relationship where one variable is a constant multiple of another. 
	In a proportional relationship, $y$ changes directly with $x$ at a constant rate.
		 For every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by $k$ units. 
			 This direct variation is a hallmark of proportional relationships.
			 
This relationship is represented by a simpler linear equation:
$$\LARGE k = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
$k$ signifies how much $y$ changes for a unit change in $x$. 
	If $x$ doubles, $y$ will also double, assuming $k$ remains constant.
##### Scalability
The constant $k$ allows the relationship to be scalable.
	Multiplying $x$ by any factor will multiply $y$ by the same factor.

Proportional relationships are scalable.
	If $x$ is scaled by a factor, $y$ will also be scaled by the same factor, maintaining the constant ratio $\frac{y}{x} = k$.
### Key Characteristics of Proportional Relationships
##### 1. Constant Ratio
The defining characteristic of a proportional relationship is that the ratio between the two variables, $\LARGE \frac{y}{x} = k$ remains constant.
	$k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.
		This means that $y$ increases or decreases in direct proportion to $x$.
		    $$\LARGE y=kx, \frac{y}{x} = k == \frac{y}{x} = \frac{k}{1}$$
The concept of proportion is built on the idea of maintaining a constant ratio between two variables. 
	This inherently leads to a linear relationship. 
		If $y$ were not directly proportional to $x$, the ratio $\frac{y}{x}$​ would not be constant.

In non-linear relationships, the ratio $\frac{y}{x}$​ changes with $x$, which means the relationship is no longer proportionate.
##### 2. Linear Relationship
The equation $y=kx$ represents a straight line that passes through the origin (0,0) on a graph, with $k$ as the slope of the line.

**Rewriting as a Linear Function** (i.e. Linear Function Form)
$$\LARGE y=kx$$
This equation is a linear function where
- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $x$ is the independent variable.
- $k$ is the slope of the line, representing the constant rate of change between $\LARGE k = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.
##### 3. Direct Variation
Proportional relationships are also known as direct variations, where one variable directly varies as a multiple of another.

### Applying Proportional Relationships in Design

**Example: Designing a Table**

Let’s revisit the table design example to see how proportional relationships might be used:

1. **Define Parameters:**
    
    - Let HHH be the height of the table.
    - Let ttt be the thickness of the legs.
2. **Proportional Relationship:**
    
    - Assume the thickness of the legs is always one-tenth of the height to maintain visual balance and structural stability.
    - This relationship can be written as: t=0.1⋅Ht = 0.1 \cdot Ht=0.1⋅H
    - Here, a=0.1a = 0.1a=0.1.
3. **Adjusting Dimensions:**
    
    - If you decide to change the height of the table, the thickness of the legs will adjust proportionally.
    - For example, if H=100H = 100H=100 cm, then t=0.1⋅100=10t = 0.1 \cdot 100 = 10t=0.1⋅100=10 cm.
    - If HHH increases to 120 cm, ttt will become 0.1⋅120=120.1 \cdot 120 = 120.1⋅120=12 cm.

### General Characteristics of Proportional Relationships

1. **Consistency:**
    
    - The ratio yx=a\frac{y}{x} = axy​=a remains constant, meaning yyy and xxx change at the same rate.
2. **Direct Proportionality:**
    
    - If xxx doubles, yyy also doubles.
    - If xxx is halved, yyy is also halved.
3. **Applications:**
    
    - Proportional relationships are common in design for scaling dimensions, ensuring aesthetic proportions, and maintaining structural integrity.
    - In architecture, proportional relationships help maintain harmony and balance in the design of buildings and structures.

### Conclusion

Proportional relationships in linear equations are powerful tools in parametric and computational design. They ensure that changes in one dimension result in predictable and proportional changes in another, maintaining the desired relationships and properties of the design. Understanding and applying these relationships allows for precise control and scalability in design processes.

### Visually Represented by the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle
That is the Relationship/Ratio/Rate can be visualized graphically as a **hypotenuse** of a right triangle.
#### The Proportion Itself (i.e. Proportion as Slope)
The slope of a line on a graph is a direct measure of proportion between the vertical change (Δ𝑦Δy) and the horizontal change (Δ𝑥Δx). This is often referred to as the "rise over run" ratio.
##### $\Delta y / \Delta x$
The **adjacent side** (i.e. **Cosine**) visually represents the $\Delta x$ i.e. **a quantity**. 
- In this case, a quantity of **change** (between $x$ values). 
The **opposite side** (i.e. **Sine**) visually represents the $\Delta y$ i.e. **a quantity**. 
- In this case, also a quantity of **change** (between $y$ values). 

![[Pasted image 20240422213732.png]]
### Proportion as a Measurement
Refers to the relative magnitude (i.e. measurable value) of one quantity in relation to another. 
###### Direct Proportion
The ratio of the two quantities remains constant.

If one magnitude doubles, then the magnitude of the other quantity must also double. 
	If $y$ is directly proportional to $x$ then:
		$y = xk$
			Where $k$ is a constant, so if $x$ doubles then $y$ also must double. 
###### Inverse Proportion
The product of two quantities remains constant.

If one magnitude doubles, then the other must halve.
	If $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$ then:
		$xy = k$
			Where $k$ is a constant. 
###### Other Proportions
Other types of relationships where the change in one variable is a function of the change in another variable, but is not necessarily linear (i.e. directly or inversely proportional).
*For example:*
$y = kx^2$
$y = k \log (x)$
$y = ke^x$
## Proportion as a Rate
A rate is a special type of proportion that measures one quantity relative to another, **often over time**. 

For instance, velocity is the rate of change of position over time, and it is proportional to the time taken for the change.
## Proportional Relationships
When someone says that one quantity is proportional to another, it means that the two quantities vary in such a way that their ratio remains constant. 
	In other words, if one quantity changes, the other quantity changes in a consistent and predictable manner

Mathematically, if $y$ is proportional to $x$, it can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE y = kx$$

where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable,
- $x$ is the independent variable,
- $k$ is the constant of proportionality.

This relationship means that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by $k$ units.
### Key Characteristics of Proportional Relationships
1. **Linear Relationship:**
    - The graph of $y$ versus $x$ is a straight line that passes through the origin (0, 0).
2. **Constant Ratio:**
    - The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always equal to $k$. This constant ratio is the defining feature of a proportional relationship.
3. **Scaling:**
    - If $x$ is multiplied by a factor, $y$ will also be multiplied by the same factor. For example, if $y = 2x$ and $x$ is doubled, then $y$ will also be doubled.
### Example
Let's consider a practical example:
#### Example: Distance and Time
- Suppose a car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.
- The distance $d$ traveled by the car is proportional to the time $t$ it travels.
This relationship can be written as:
$$\LARGE d = 60t$$
Here, $d$ is the distance, $t$ is the time, and 60 is the constant of proportionality (speed).
- If the car travels for 1 hour ($t = 1$), the distance is $d = 60 \times 1 = 60$ miles.
- If the car travels for 2 hours ($t = 2$), the distance is $d = 60 \times 2 = 120$ miles.
The ratio $\frac{d}{t} = 60$ remains constant, indicating a proportional relationship between distance and time.
### Visual Representation
In a graph of $d$ versus $t$:
- The x-axis represents time $t$.
- The y-axis represents distance $d$.
- The graph is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 60.
This straight line shows that as time increases, the distance increases proportionally.
## Proportional Relationships as Functions
A proportional relationship is a specific type of function where the output is directly proportional to the input. 
	In mathematical terms, if $y$ is proportional to $x$, it can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE y=kx$$
Here, $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
	This is a linear function where the graph is a straight line passing through the origin.
### Functions
A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the codomain) such that each input is related to exactly one output. This can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE f:X→Y$$

where $f$ is the function, $X$ is the domain, and $Y$ is the codomain.
### General Functions
However, functions are much more general than just proportional relationships. They can describe a wide variety of relationships between inputs and outputs, including but not limited to:

1. **Linear Functions:** General form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
    
2. **Quadratic Functions:** General form is $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, representing parabolas.
    
3. **Polynomial Functions:** General form is $y = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$.
    
4. **Exponential Functions:** General form is $y = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
    
5. **Logarithmic Functions:** General form is $y = a \cdot \log_b(x)$.
    
6. **Trigonometric Functions:** Examples include $y = \sin(x)$, $y = \cos(x)$, etc.
### Example: Non-Proportional Functions

#### Quadratic Function

A quadratic function can be written as:
$$\LARGE y = ax^2 + bx + c$$

In this case, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not proportional, as the output $y$ depends on the square of the input $x$, along with linear and constant terms.
