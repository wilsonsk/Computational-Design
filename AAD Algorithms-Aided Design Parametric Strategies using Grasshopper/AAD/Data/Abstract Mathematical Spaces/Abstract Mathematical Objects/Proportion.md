# Proportion
## Is a Relationship (i.e. a Ratio or a Rate) Between Quantities
### Visually Represented by the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle
That is the Relationship/Ratio/Rate can be visualized graphically as a **hypotenuse** of a right triangle.
#### The Proportion Itself (i.e. Proportion as Slope)
The slope of a line on a graph is a direct measure of proportion between the vertical change (Œîùë¶Œîy) and the horizontal change (Œîùë•Œîx). This is often referred to as the "rise over run" ratio.
##### $\Delta y / \Delta x$
The **adjacent side** (i.e. **Cosine**) visually represents the $\Delta x$ i.e. **a quantity**. 
- In this case, a quantity of **change** (between $x$ values). 
The **opposite side** (i.e. **Sine**) visually represents the $\Delta y$ i.e. **a quantity**. 
- In this case, also a quantity of **change** (between $y$ values).

### Proportion as a Measurement
Refers to the relative magnitude (i.e. measurable value) of one quantity in relation to another. 
###### Direct Proportion
The ratio of the two quantities remains constant.

If one magnitude doubles, then the magnitude of the other quantity must also double. 
	If $y$ is directly proportional to $x$ then:
		$y = xk$
			Where $k$ is a constant, so if $x$ doubles then $y$ also must double. 
###### Inverse Proportion
The product of two quantities remains constant.

If one magnitude doubles, then the other must halve.
	If $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$ then:
		$xy = k$
			Where $k$ is a constant. 
###### Other Proportions
Other types of relationships where the change in one variable is a function of the change in another variable, but is not necessarily linear (i.e. directly or inversely proportional).
*For example:*
$y = kx^2$
$y = k \log (x)$
$y = ke^x$
## Proportion as a Rate
A rate is a special type of proportion that measures one quantity relative to another, **often over time**. 

For instance, velocity is the rate of change of position over time, and it is proportional to the time taken for the change.
## Proportional Relationships
When someone says that one quantity is proportional to another, it means that the two quantities vary in such a way that their ratio remains constant. 
	In other words, if one quantity changes, the other quantity changes in a consistent and predictable manner

Mathematically, if $y$ is proportional to $x$, it can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE y = kx$$

where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable,
- $x$ is the independent variable,
- $k$ is the constant of proportionality.

This relationship means that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by $k$ units.
### Key Characteristics of Proportional Relationships
1. **Linear Relationship:**
    - The graph of $y$ versus $x$ is a straight line that passes through the origin (0, 0).
2. **Constant Ratio:**
    - The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always equal to $k$. This constant ratio is the defining feature of a proportional relationship.
3. **Scaling:**
    - If $x$ is multiplied by a factor, $y$ will also be multiplied by the same factor. For example, if $y = 2x$ and $x$ is doubled, then $y$ will also be doubled.
### Example
Let's consider a practical example:
#### Example: Distance and Time
- Suppose a car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.
- The distance $d$ traveled by the car is proportional to the time $t$ it travels.
This relationship can be written as:
$$\LARGE d = 60t$$
Here, $d$ is the distance, $t$ is the time, and 60 is the constant of proportionality (speed).
- If the car travels for 1 hour ($t = 1$), the distance is $d = 60 \times 1 = 60$ miles.
- If the car travels for 2 hours ($t = 2$), the distance is $d = 60 \times 2 = 120$ miles.
The ratio $\frac{d}{t} = 60$ remains constant, indicating a proportional relationship between distance and time.
### Visual Representation
In a graph of $d$ versus $t$:
- The x-axis represents time $t$.
- The y-axis represents distance $d$.
- The graph is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 60.
This straight line shows that as time increases, the distance increases proportionally.
## Proportional Relationships as Functions
A proportional relationship is a specific type of function where the output is directly proportional to the input. 
	In mathematical terms, if $y$ is proportional to $x$, it can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE y=kx$$
Here, $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
	This is a linear function where the graph is a straight line passing through the origin.
### Functions
A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the codomain) such that each input is related to exactly one output. This can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE f:X‚ÜíY$$

where $f$ is the function, $X$ is the domain, and $Y$ is the codomain.
### General Functions
However, functions are much more general than just proportional relationships. They can describe a wide variety of relationships between inputs and outputs, including but not limited to:

1. **Linear Functions:** General form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
    
2. **Quadratic Functions:** General form is $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, representing parabolas.
    
3. **Polynomial Functions:** General form is $y = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$.
    
4. **Exponential Functions:** General form is $y = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
    
5. **Logarithmic Functions:** General form is $y = a \cdot \log_b(x)$.
    
6. **Trigonometric Functions:** Examples include $y = \sin(x)$, $y = \cos(x)$, etc.
### Example: Non-Proportional Functions

#### Quadratic Function

A quadratic function can be written as:
$$\LARGE y = ax^2 + bx + c$$

In this case, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not proportional, as the output $y$ depends on the square of the input $x$, along with linear and constant terms.
