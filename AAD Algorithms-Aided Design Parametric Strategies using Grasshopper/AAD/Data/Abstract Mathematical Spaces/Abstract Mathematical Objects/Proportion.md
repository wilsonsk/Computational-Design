# Proportion
## Is a Relationship (i.e. a Ratio or a Rate) Between Quantities
### Visually Represented by the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle
That is the Relationship/Ratio/Rate can be visualized graphically as a **hypotenuse** of a right triangle.
#### The Proportion Itself (i.e. Proportion as Slope)
The slope of a line on a graph is a direct measure of proportion between the vertical change (Œîùë¶Œîy) and the horizontal change (Œîùë•Œîx). This is often referred to as the "rise over run" ratio.
##### $\Delta y / \Delta x$
The **adjacent side** (i.e. **Cosine**) visually represents the $\Delta x$ i.e. **a quantity**. 
- In this case, a quantity of **change** (between $x$ values). 
The **opposite side** (i.e. **Sine**) visually represents the $\Delta y$ i.e. **a quantity**. 
- In this case, also a quantity of **change** (between $y$ values).

### Proportion as a Measurement
Refers to the relative magnitude (i.e. measurable value) of one quantity in relation to another. 
###### Direct Proportion
The ratio of the two quantities remains constant.

If one magnitude doubles, then the magnitude of the other quantity must also double. 
	If $y$ is directly proportional to $x$ then:
		$y = xk$
			Where $k$ is a constant, so if $x$ doubles then $y$ also must double. 
###### Inverse Proportion
The product of two quantities remains constant.

If one magnitude doubles, then the other must halve.
	If $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$ then:
		$xy = k$
			Where $k$ is a constant. 
###### Other Proportions
Other types of relationships where the change in one variable is a function of the change in another variable, but is not necessarily linear (i.e. directly or inversely proportional).
*For example:*
$y = kx^2$
$y = k \log (x)$
$y = ke^x$

## Proportion as a Rate
A rate is a special type of proportion that measures one quantity relative to another, **often over time**. 

For instance, velocity is the rate of change of position over time, and it is proportional to the time taken for the change.
