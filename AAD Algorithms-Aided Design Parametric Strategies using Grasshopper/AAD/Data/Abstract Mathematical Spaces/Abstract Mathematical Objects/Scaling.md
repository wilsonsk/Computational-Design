# Scaling (i.e. Dilation)
## Scaling as a [[Transformations/Transformations|Transformation]] (i.e. [[Newton's Second Law#Motion|motion]])
A transformation $T$ is called a **scaling transformation** (or simply **scaling**) if there exists a constant $k$ with $k > 1$ such that for any value $x$ in the space, the transformation $T$ maps $x$ to $k \cdot x$. 
	This operation increases the magnitude of $x$ by the factor $k$.

Formally, if $T$ is a transformation and $x$ is a value or vector, then $T$ is a scaling transformation if there exists a constant $k$ with $k > 1$ such that:
$$\LARGE T(x) = k \cdot x$$
Where $k > 1$.
Where $x$ is any element in the space and $T(x)$ is the transformed element. 
	The transformation $T$ increases the magnitude of $x$ by the factor $k$.

### A Scaling (alone) Represents a Directly Proportional Relationship
Where $\LARGE k$ is [[Division#Constant of Direct Proportionality is a Constant Ratio ($ LARGE k$)|the Constant of Proportionality]].
### Explanation
- **Transformation $T$**: This is a function that maps values in a space to other values in the same space.
- **Constant $k$**: This is the scaling factor, which must be greater than 1. The value of $k$ determines the degree of enlargement.
- **Value $x$**: This is any element in the space that is being scaled.
### Example
Given a value $x = 2$ and a scalar $k = 10$:
$x' = k \cdot x = 10 \cdot 2 = 20$
Here, the value $x = 2$ is scaled by $10$, resulting in the enlarged value $x' = 20$.
### Contexts and Terminology
- **Linear Algebra**: When a vector or a value is multiplied by a scalar $k$ (with $k > 1$), it results in the scaling or dilation of the vector or value, increasing its magnitude.
- **Geometry**: Scaling a geometric figure by a factor greater than 1 increases its size, often referred to as dilating the figure.
- **Functional Analysis**: In this context, dilation is a function that increases the distance between any two points by a fixed proportion.
## Scaling as Area
That is a Scalar as a [[Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Physics/Dimensional Analysis/Measurement#Dimensions|Dimension]].
$$\LARGE Area = \text{Width} \cdot \text{Height}$$
This way we can conceptualize a scalar as one of the dimensions.
	And then we can conceive that the constant being scaled is another dimension.

Where you have, "one" amount of height for every number of width.
