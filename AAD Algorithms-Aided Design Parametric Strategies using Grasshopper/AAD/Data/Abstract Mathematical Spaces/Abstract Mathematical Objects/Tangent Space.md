# Tangent Space
A tangent space is a mathematical construct that represents all possible directions in which one can tangentially pass through a given point on a surface. 
	It is essentially a linear (flat) space that "touches" the curved surface at a single point, providing a local approximation of the surface.
## Visualizing Tangent Space
#### At a Point on a Curve
Imagine a curve on a plane, like a smooth, winding road.
	At any given point on this road, you can think of the tangent space as a straight line that just touches the curve at that point and goes in the direction of the curve at that point.
#### At a Point on a Surface
Now imagine a more complex shape, like the surface of a hill.
	At any point on this hill, the tangent space is a flat plane that touches the hill at that point and is oriented in the direction the surface is heading at that point.

## Why Tangent Space is Useful
#### Local Linearization
Tangent spaces help simplify the analysis of complex, curved surfaces by providing a flat, linear approximation that is easier to work with mathematically and computationally.
