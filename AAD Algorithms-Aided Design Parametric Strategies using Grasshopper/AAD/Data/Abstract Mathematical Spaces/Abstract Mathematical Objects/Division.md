# Division
Can be thought of as simply the amount of one quantity of a "thing" that is associated with a separate quantity of another "thing".
	I.e.  A ratio:
		A ratio is a mathematical expression that compares two quantities, showing the relative size of one quantity in relation to the other.

Division can be conceptualized as the operation of **distributing or partitioning one quantity by another**, thereby determining how many times the divisor is contained within the dividend.

Consider two quantities, a and b. 
	The division of a by b, $\LARGE {a\over b}$ seeks to determine the factor by which b must be scaled to obtain a. 
		This operation answers the question: "How many units of b are there in a?"

## Division as a Proportional Relationship (i.e. Direct Proportionality)
The fraction $\frac{A}{B} = k$ abstractly represents how many groups of size $B$ fit into the total $A$. 
	This concept helps in understanding proportional relationships by breaking down and visualizing quantities in terms of smaller, equal parts.
##### Direct Proportionality
Two quantities $x$ and $y$ are said to be in direct proportion (or directly proportional) if they increase or decrease at the same rate.
	This can be expressed as $y = kx$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.
###### Scaling Up and Down
In a direct proportion, any change in $x$ results in a proportional change in $y$.
	If $x$ is scaled by a factor, $y$ is scaled by the same factor.
		When one quantity doubles, the other doubles.
		When one quantity is halved, the other is halved.
		The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always constant and equal to $k$.
##### Proportional Relationship
A proportional relationship refers to a consistent ratio between two quantities. 
	This is often represented in the form $\frac{y}{x} = k$ or $y = kx$.
###### Constant Ratio of Proportional Relationship/Direct Proportionality
The constant ratio $k$ means that for any given $x$ and $y$, dividing $y$ by $x$ always gives $k$.
	This ratio remains unchanged regardless of the specific values of $x$ and $y$.
###### Proportional Relationship Implies Direct Proportionality
A proportional relationship does imply direct proportionality because it maintains a consistent/constant ratio between the quantities involved.

Proportional relationships inherently imply direct proportionality because they maintain a constant ratio.
	This means if $x$ and $y$ are in a proportional relationship, increasing $x$ will lead to a proportional increase in $y$ and vice versa.
### Proportional Reasoning
#### Understanding Proportional Relationships
Proportional relationships involve comparing quantities to see how one quantity scales with respect to another.
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} = k$$
A proportional relationship between two quantities $a$ and $b$ means that the ratio of $a$ to $b$ is constant. This constant ratio is represented by $k$.
	Mathematically, this is expressed as $\frac{a}{b} = k$, where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
#### Visualizing with Grouping
Imagine any quantity $A$ as a collection of smaller, equal parts. 
	For simplicity, let's consider $A = a$ and each part as $b$ units.
		When we write $\frac{a}{b} = k$, we are essentially asking, "**How many groups of $b$ are there in $a$?**" 
			This $k$ represents the number of such groups.
#### Decomposing the Quantity
Decompose the total quantity ($a$) into parts where each part has a value of $b$:
	This means dividing $a$ into segments, each representing a size of $b$.
		The number of such segments is $k$, where $a = k \cdot b$.
#### Fraction Interpretation
The fraction $\frac{a}{b} = k$ expresses this decomposition. It tells us how many times the denominator ($b$) fits into the numerator ($a$).
	Mathematically, $\frac{a}{b} = k$, which means there are $k$ segments of $b$ in $a$.
#### Proportional Relationship
##### Scaling Relationships
If $a$ scales, the number of $b$-sized groups also scales proportionally.
	If $a$ doubles, the number of $b$-sized groups doubles, maintaining the proportion.
##### Inverse Understanding
The inverse, $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{k}$, indicates the fraction of the total $a$ that each group $b$ represents.
	For $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{k}$, each group of $b$ is $\frac{1}{k}$ of the total $a$.
##### Constant of Direct Proportionality is a Constant Ratio ($\LARGE k$)
$$\LARGE a = kb$$
This ratio compares the values of $a$ and $b$ directly.
	The ratio $\frac{a}{b} = k$ is maintained regardless of the actual values of $a$ and $b$, showing the constant relationship between them.
		This constant ratio $k$ is key to understanding proportional reasoning, as it indicates a consistent relationship that scales uniformly.

The constant of proportionality, $k$ can be a ratio or a rate.
	The constant is specifically the constant of proportionality, and it directly links $a$ and $b$ without any offset.

## Division as Distribution 
Division distributes the total quantity a into equal parts of size b. 
	*For example*, if a represents a collection and b the size of each subset, division tells us how many such subsets can be formed.

$$ \text{When we divide } a \text{ by } b \text{, we are scaling } a \text{ down by distributing } a \text{ into } b \text{ equal parts.}$$
 $$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} \text{ means we split } a \text{ into } b \text{ groups, each containing } \frac{a}{b} \text{units.}$$
#### Intuitive (Geometric) Notion of Division
Mathematically, $x = \frac{a}{b}$ shows that $x$ is the portion of $a$ contained in each of the $b$ parts.

$$\LARGE  x = \frac{a}{b}$$
##### $\LARGE a$
Picture $a$ as a large block or total quantity.
##### Dividing into $b$ Groups
Divide this large block into $b$ smaller, equal groups.
	Each group represents a fraction of the total $a$.
##### Contribution Amount $x$
The quantity $x$ represents the size or amount $a$ in each of these smaller blocks, $b$.

Each group contains an amount of $x$.
	The total $x$ is the portion of $a$ that each group of $b$ contributes.
### Distributing a Smaller Number into a Larger Number
### Distributing a Larger Number into a Smaller Number
### What $b$ Represents
You can interpret the ratio $a / b = c$ in such a way that $b$ represents the number of "steps" or "groups" that make up the total amount $a$, where each group has an amount $c$.

1. **Given**: $a / b = c$
2. This means that if you divide $a$ into $b$ equal parts (or groups), each part will be of size $c$.

Now, if we rearrange the equation, we get: 
$$\LARGE a = b \times c$$

This implies that the total amount $a$ is composed of $b$ groups, each of size $c$. 
	I.e. An [[#Contracting an Area|Area]]
	Therefore, $b$ can indeed be thought of as the number of steps or groups in $a$.
###### A Step
A "step" refers to one of the equal subdivisions or units into which the total amount $a$ is divided. 
###### $b$ as a Step
**Number of Steps ($b$)**: This is the number of equal parts or divisions that the total amount $a$ is broken into. Each step represents one of these equal parts.
##### Visual Notion of $b$
- **Total Length of the Line ($a$)**: Let's assume the total length of the line is $a$ units.
    
- **Number of Subdivisions ($b$)**: This is the number of equal parts into which the line is divided.
    
- **Length of Each Subdivision ($c$)**: This is the length of each individual subdivision, which can be found by dividing the total length of the line by the number of subdivisions. So, $c = \frac{a}{b}$.

## Division as a [[Ratio|Ratio]] (i.e. as a [[Data/Abstract Mathematical Spaces/Physics/Dimensional Analysis/Measurement|Measurement]])
Division measures the quantity a using the unit b. 
	If b is a standard unit, division indicates how many times this unit fits into a.

## Ratio as a Fraction
### Fraction
A fraction represents a part of a whole. 
	It is a way to describe how many parts of a certain size are needed to make up a whole.

Mathematically, if $0 < b < a$, then $b$ is a proper fraction of $a$, meaning $b$ represents a part of $a$.
	When $b$ is smaller than $a$, we can consider $b$ as a fraction of $a$.

## A Ratio as a Scalar
When we talk about contraction in the context of scaling with a scalar less than 1, we mean that we are effectively reducing the original quantity. 
$$\LARGE \text{If } \space b = a$$
$$\LARGE \text{then } \frac{a}{b} = 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{If } \space b = 1 \space \text{then } \frac{a}{b} = a$$
### Contracting to Make a Quantity, or Value, Smaller
Via contracting some constant as a scalar.
$$\LARGE \text{If }a < b$$
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} = \text{a fraction (of b) that is } < 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{So, if } a < b \text{ then } a \text{ is a "part" (i.e. a fraction) of } b$$
$$\LARGE \text{Meaning b is no longer a whole number, } \frac{b}{b}$$
$$\LARGE \text{But that b is a fraction of itself,} \frac{a}{b}$$
$$\LARGE \text{The quantity a is a fraction of b.}$$
$$\LARGE \text{This means a represents a part of the whole b.}$$
### [[Scaling|Scaling]] to Make a Quantity, or Value, Larger
$$\LARGE \text{If }a > b$$
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{b} > 1$$
$$\LARGE \text{Therefore, } \frac{a}{b} \text{ becomes a Scalar}$$
$$\LARGE \text{So, if } a > b \text{ then } b \text{ is a "part" (i.e. a fraction) of } a$$
$$ \text{I.e. a can be divided into parts of size b, but the number of parts may not be a whole number if a is not an exact multiple of b.}$$
##### Think About It...
If $b$ is smaller than $1$, it itself becomes a fraction.
	The ratio becomes, "how many of these small "pieces" can fit evenly into this larger number?"
$$\LARGE \frac{10}{0.1} = 100$$
$$\LARGE \text{This Ratio asks, "how many } 0.1 \text{'s (i.e. } \frac{1}{10}'s) \text{ fit evenly into 10?}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And the Answer is that 100, 0.1's can fit into 10.}$$
$$\LARGE \frac{0.1}{10} = 0.01$$
$$\LARGE \text{This Ratio asks, "how many } 10 \text{'s (i.e. } \frac{10}{1}'s) \text{ fit evenly into 0.1?}$$
$$\LARGE \text{And the Answer is that only a fraction of 10 (i.e. 0.01) can fit into 0.1.}$$
This is why dividing by a fraction is actually
$$\LARGE \frac{a}{(\frac{1}{b})} == a \cdot \frac{b}{1}$$
$$\LARGE \text{Therefore, }\frac{1}{b} \text{ in functioning as } \frac{b}{1} \text{, itself becomes a Scalar}$$

## Contracting
### Contraction as a [[Euclidean Transformations|Euclidean Transformation]]
If you scale a figure by a factor $k$ where $0 \leq k < 1$, every point of the figure is moved closer to a fixed point (usually the origin), and the entire figure is reduced in size.
	This is a contraction.

A transformation $T$ is called a **contracting transformation** (or simply a **contraction**) if there exists a constant $k$ with $\LARGE 0≤k<1$ such that for all points $x$ and $y$ in the space, the distance between $T(x)$ and $T(y)$ is strictly less than the distance between $x$ and $y$, scaled by $k$. 
###### Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
$$\LARGE d(T(x),T(y))≤k⋅d(x,y)$$
Where $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ represents the distance metric in the space.
###### Transformation $T$
This is a function that maps points in a space to other points in the same space.
###### Constant $k$
This is the contraction constant, which must satisfy $0 \leq k < 1$. 
	The value of $k$ determines the degree of shrinking.
###### Distance $d(\cdot, \cdot)$
This is the metric used to measure the distance between two points in the space.

### Contracting an Area
Where a [[Scaling#Scaling as Area|scalar is a dimension]].
	A fractional scalar

You have $\LARGE p$ amount of $\LARGE \frac{1}{k}$.
	I.e. You have "one" $\LARGE \frac{1}{k}$ for every $\LARGE p$.
	
That is a Scalar as a Dimension.
$$\LARGE Area = \text{Width} \cdot \text{Height}$$
This way we can conceptualize a scalar as one of the dimensions.
	And then we can conceive that the constant being scaled is another dimension.

$$\LARGE \text{scalar,} \space k = \frac{1}{n} = \text{"height"}$$
Let's make $k$ the $height$.
$$\LARGE \text{constant}, p = m = \text{"width"}$$
#### How this Area "Shrinks"
Prior to being contracted, $p$ had an area of 
$$\LARGE 1 \space \text{height}\cdot p\space \text{width}$$
After contraction, the new area is 
$$\LARGE \frac{1}{n} \space \text{height} \cdot p \space \text{width}$$
So one dimension (in this case, height) has been reduced and therefore, so has the entire area.

#### Mathematical Interpretation
The equation $x = p \times \frac{1}{k}$ can be rewritten as:
$$\LARGE x = \frac{p}{k}$$

This indicates that each of the $k$ groups contributes an equal amount $x$ from the total force $p$.

But also, if we then scale the $x$ amount contained by each of the $k$ pieces of $p$, then we obtain $p
	Where we would have $k$ many pieces of $x$ amount.
$$\LARGE xk = p$$
#### Example
Suppose $p = 6$ and $k = 2$:

- **Total Force $p = 6$:**
    - You have a total force of 6 units.
- **Dividing into $k = 2$ Groups:**
    - You divide this force into 2 equal groups.
    - Each group has $\frac{6}{2} = 3$ units.
- **Deflection Contribution $x$:**
    - Each group of 3 units of force contributes to the total deflection.
    - Thus, the total deflection $x$ is 3 units
#### Hooke's Law and Contraction Example
Hooke's Law states that the force $F$ needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance $x$ is proportional to that distance.
	The law can be written as:
$$F=kx$$
where:
- $F$ is the force applied to the spring,
- $k$ is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the spring),
- $x$ is the displacement or deflection of the spring from its equilibrium position.
##### Understanding $x = \frac{F}{k}$
In mathematical terms, scaling a variable $p$ by a factor of $\frac{1}{k}$ (where $k > 1$) results in a smaller quantity.
Rearranging Hooke's Law to solve for $x$ (the deflection), we get:
$$x = \frac{F}{k}$$
In this equation:
- $F$ represents the total force applied,
- $k$ represents the spring constant,
- $x$ represents the resulting deflection of the spring.
#### Understanding $x = p \times \frac{1}{k}$
Given the equation $x = p \times \frac{1}{k}$, you can visualize or understand this as the total force $p$ being split into $k$ equal groups, where each group contains $x$ amount of the original $p$.
#### Intuitive (Geometric) Notion of Division
1. **Total Force $p$:**
    - Picture the total force $p$ as a large block or total quantity.
2. **Dividing into $k$ Groups:**
    - Divide this large block into $k$ smaller, equal groups.
    - Each group represents a fraction of the total force.
3. **Deflection Contribution $x$:**
	- The quantity $x$ represents the size or amount of each of these smaller blocks.
	- Mathematically, $x = p \times \frac{1}{k}$ shows that $x$ is the portion of $p$ contained in each of the $k$ parts.
    - Each group contains an amount of deflection $x$.
    - The total deflection $x$ is the portion of $p$ that each group contributes.
##### Visualizing Contraction
To understand $x = \frac{F}{k}$ as a form of contraction:
1. **Total Force $F$:**
    - Think of $F$ as a single large block representing the total force applied to the spring.
2. **Spring Constant $k$:**
    - The spring constant $k$ acts as a divisor, indicating how many parts the force $F$ is split into based on the stiffness of the spring.
3. **Resulting Deflection $x$:**
    - The deflection $x$ is the portion of the total force $F$ that results in the displacement of the spring. It is calculated by dividing the total force $F$ by the spring constant $k$.
##### Detailed Verbal Explanation
Imagine you have a certain amount of force $F$ (like pushing on a spring) and you want to see how much the spring stretches. 
	The spring constant $k$ tells you how stiff the spring is, and this stiffness affects how much the spring stretches when you apply the force.
1. **The Whole Quantity $F$:**
    - Picture $F$ as the total force you apply to the spring. This is a complete, undivided amount of force.
2. **Dividing into $k$ Equal Parts:**
    - The spring constant $k$ divides this total force into $k$ smaller, equal parts. If $k$ is large (a stiff spring), each part is small, meaning the spring doesn't stretch much. If $k$ is small (a less stiff spring), each part is larger, meaning the spring stretches more.
3. **Each Part’s Contribution to Deflection $x$:**
    - The deflection $x$ is the amount of stretch that each of these $k$ parts contributes to the total stretch of the spring. Essentially, $x = \frac{F}{k}$ tells you how much each part of the force contributes to the overall deflection.
#### Practical Examples
###### Number Division
10/2​=5 indicates that 10 can be divided into 5 parts, each of size 2.
###### Vector Scaling
Dividing a vector 𝑣⃗ by a scalar k scales the vector by k1​, effectively shrinking or expanding it inversely.
	Just as multiplication scales one quantity by another, division as a ratio scales down one quantity by the other, showing the extent to which one is a fraction of the other.
###### Function Division
For functions f(x) and g(x), g(x)f(x)​ determines how the values of f compare to those of g point by point.
## Ratio	
That is a relationship between two quantities, expressed as the quotient of one divided by the other.
	I.e. Division as a ratio is the operation that defines the comparative relationship between two quantities, a and b, expressed as ba​. 
		This ratio reflects how many units of b are contained within a, providing a dimensionless measure of their relative magnitudes.

If we consider two variables a and b, the ratio of a to b is ba​.
	This abstraction applies whether a and b are elements of a set of numbers, vectors in a vector space, measures of physical quantities, or even more abstract entities such as functions or probabilities.

The significance of a ratio lies in its ability to provide a dimensionless measure of relative size or magnitude, enabling the comparison of different entities on a common scale. 
	This abstract conceptualization of a ratio extends to numerous fields, including geometry, algebra, probability theory, and more, where it serves as a fundamental tool for understanding proportional relationships and comparative analysis.
#### Abstract Interpretation of Division as a Ratio:
###### Comparison
Division as a ratio expresses the relative size of one quantity to another. 
	*For example*, the ratio ba​ shows how 𝑎a compares to b.
###### Proportionality
This relationship reveals the proportion of one quantity to another, often indicating a balance or imbalance between them.
#### Mathematical Context:
###### Basic Ratio
For quantities a and b, the ratio ba​ represents how many times b fits into a. 
	This can be interpreted as the factor by which b must be scaled to equal a.
###### Geometric Interpretation
In geometry, the ratio of two lengths ba​ describes their proportional relationship, which is fundamental in similarity and scaling transformations.
###### Probability
In probability theory, the ratio of favorable outcomes to possible outcomes defines the likelihood of an event occurring.

## Ratio in [[Dimensional Analysis|Dimensional Analysis]]
In Grigory Barenblatt's book "Scaling, Self-similarity, and Intermediate Asymptotics," a ratio in terms of dimensional analysis is typically viewed as a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the relative magnitudes of two quantities of the same dimension. Ratios play a critical role in scaling laws and similarity solutions because they allow for the comparison of different systems or phenomena in a normalized way.

### Key Concepts from Barenblatt’s Work:

1. **Dimensionless Numbers**:
    
    - A ratio in dimensional analysis often leads to the creation of dimensionless numbers, which are essential in understanding the scaling behavior of physical systems. Examples include Reynolds number, Froude number, and Mach number.
2. **Scaling Laws**:
    
    - Scaling laws involve relationships between dimensionless quantities. These laws reveal how different physical quantities scale with each other when the system's size or another relevant parameter changes.
3. **Self-Similarity**:
    
    - Self-similar solutions often depend on dimensionless ratios. Self-similarity implies that the shape of the solution does not change when rescaled by certain factors, which are expressed as ratios.
4. **Intermediate Asymptotics**:
    
    - In intermediate asymptotics, ratios of lengths, times, or other physical quantities are used to find similarity solutions that are valid in certain intermediate regimes of the physical problem.

### Practical Example from Barenblatt’s Work:

Consider the problem of fluid flow around a sphere. One important dimensionless ratio here is the Reynolds number (𝑅𝑒Re), which is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in the fluid:

𝑅𝑒=𝜌𝑣𝐿𝜇Re=μρvL​

where:

- 𝜌ρ is the fluid density (dimension: [M L−3−3])
- 𝑣v is the velocity of the fluid (dimension: [L T−1−1])
- 𝐿L is the characteristic length (dimension: [L])
- 𝜇μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (dimension: [M L−1−1 T−1−1])

By analyzing this ratio, one can determine the flow regime (laminar or turbulent) and predict the drag force on the sphere.

### Importance of Ratios in Dimensional Analysis:

1. **Normalization**:
    
    - Ratios normalize quantities, making it easier to compare systems of different scales.
2. **Similarity and Scaling**:
    
    - Ratios are fundamental in identifying similarity and scaling laws, which are used to generalize the behavior of physical systems.
3. **Reduction of Variables**:
    
    - Using dimensionless ratios reduces the number of variables in a problem, simplifying the analysis and leading to more general solutions.

In summary, according to Barenblatt, ratios in dimensional analysis serve as fundamental tools for creating dimensionless numbers, which are critical for understanding scaling laws, self-similarity, and the behavior of physical systems under various conditions. These concepts are extensively discussed in his work "Scaling, Self-similarity, and Intermediate Asymptotics."
