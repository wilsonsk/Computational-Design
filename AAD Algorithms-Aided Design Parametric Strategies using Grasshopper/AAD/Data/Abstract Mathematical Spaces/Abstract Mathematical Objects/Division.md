# Division
Can be thought of as simply the amount of one quantity of a "thing" that is associated with a separate quantity of another "thing".
	I.e.  A ratio.

Division can be conceptualized as the operation of **distributing or partitioning one quantity by another**, thereby determining how many times the divisor is contained within the dividend.

Consider two quantities, a and b. 
	The division of a by b, seeks to determine the factor by which b must be scaled to obtain a. 
		This operation answers the question: "How many units of b are there in a?"
#### Abstract Interpretation
###### Distribution 
Division distributes the total quantity a into equal parts of size b. 
	*For example*, if a represents a collection and b the size of each subset, division tells us how many such subsets can be formed.
###### Measurement
Division measures the quantity a using the unit b. 
	If b is a standard unit, division indicates how many times this unit fits into a.

#### Practical Examples
###### Number Division
10/2‚Äã=5 indicates that 10 can be divided into 5 parts, each of size 2.
###### Vector Scaling
Dividing a vector ùë£‚Éó by a scalar k scales the vector by k1‚Äã, effectively shrinking or expanding it inversely.
	Just as multiplication scales one quantity by another, division as a ratio scales down one quantity by the other, showing the extent to which one is a fraction of the other.
###### Function Division
For functions f(x) and g(x), g(x)f(x)‚Äã determines how the values of f compare to those of g point by point.
## Ratio	
That is a relationship between two quantities, expressed as the quotient of one divided by the other.
	I.e. Division as a ratio is the operation that defines the comparative relationship between two quantities, a and b, expressed as ba‚Äã. 
		This ratio reflects how many units of b are contained within a, providing a dimensionless measure of their relative magnitudes.

If we consider two variables a and b, the ratio of a to b is ba‚Äã.
	This abstraction applies whether a and b are elements of a set of numbers, vectors in a vector space, measures of physical quantities, or even more abstract entities such as functions or probabilities.

The significance of a ratio lies in its ability to provide a dimensionless measure of relative size or magnitude, enabling the comparison of different entities on a common scale. 
	This abstract conceptualization of a ratio extends to numerous fields, including geometry, algebra, probability theory, and more, where it serves as a fundamental tool for understanding proportional relationships and comparative analysis.
#### Abstract Interpretation of Division as a Ratio:
###### Comparison
Division as a ratio expresses the relative size of one quantity to another. 
	*For example*, the ratio ba‚Äã shows how ùëéa compares to b.
###### Proportionality
This relationship reveals the proportion of one quantity to another, often indicating a balance or imbalance between them.
#### Mathematical Context:
###### Basic Ratio
For quantities a and b, the ratio ba‚Äã represents how many times b fits into a. 
	This can be interpreted as the factor by which b must be scaled to equal a.
###### Geometric Interpretation
In geometry, the ratio of two lengths ba‚Äã describes their proportional relationship, which is fundamental in similarity and scaling transformations.
###### Probability
In probability theory, the ratio of favorable outcomes to possible outcomes defines the likelihood of an event occurring.
