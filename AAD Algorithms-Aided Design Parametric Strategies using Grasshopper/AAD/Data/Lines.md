# Lines

**Tangent Lines and Curves**: Tangent lines to curves or surfaces in a parametric design context represent instantaneous directions of movement at points on curves or surfaces. They are critical in understanding how shapes change and can help in analyzing and controlling curvature, which is fundamental in creating ergonomically and aesthetically pleasing designs.
