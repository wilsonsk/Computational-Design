# 3D Parametric Equations

## **A plane** is defined by **two vectors** and a **point** *p* known to be on the plane.

The plane is composed of all the points that can be **reached** by any **linear combination** of the two vectors, and therefore, any point *p* can be reached in this way. 

## The **Parametric Equation of a Plane** takes **two parameters**:
Each acting as a **scalar** for each of the respective vectors that define the plane. 
	*p(u,v) = p + (u* * vector u + v * vector v)

Typically, the vectors *u* and *v* are defined to be mutually perpendicular and of standard unit length. This establishes a 2D coordinate system on the plane.
