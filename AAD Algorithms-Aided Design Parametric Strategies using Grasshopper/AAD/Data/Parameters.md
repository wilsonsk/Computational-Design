# Parameters
The **measurable** or **quantifiable** aspects of an [[Abstract Mathematical Objects|abstract mathematical object]] or physical object.
###### Attributes of Geometric Objects:
- Representing properties such as length of an edge, radius of a circle, the angle between two lines, a position or point in a given space, etc.
###### Control Variables:

Represent variables that can be manipulated to change the outcome of a relationship between data. 
	- **Mathematical Representation**:
		- Parameters are specifically used to define a position of a point on a curve or surface.
			- Parameters in grasshopper/rhino 3d are the **SCALARS** of vectors when in linear combination.
				- Which are able to access every point in a plane or space.

###### Associativity and Dependencies:
- Parameters depend on one another/influence each other. 
	- Through association (i.e. relationships) that define and maintain the structure of a design.

###### Drive the Geometry:
Control the shapes and forms in a model.

**Quantification of Properties:** Mapping via units
	1. Numbers facilitate the measuring of physical properties and design parameters such as dimensions, angles, distances and material properties via a **mapping of units to the geometrical aspects of an object**
