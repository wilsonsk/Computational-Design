# Data
*Sets of sets of ...*: increasing complexity through composition.

## Data is differentiation:
Data is the basic ingredient to be **analyzed** and **considered** in any design practice. 

In Computational and Parametric Design, differentiation is represented by **numbers**, which can represent **a set of infinite values of differentiation** and **facilitate a system of relationships** that enable composition, structure, and abstraction through increasing complexity.

## Data are Inputs. And Numbers are a Type of Data:

[[Numbers]] are the foundational element ([[Elemental Building Blocks]]) of data. The manipulation and control of numbers determine not only the basis of every design, but also its evolution, complexity and adaptability. 

Through the lens of parametric design, every aspect of an object or space can be encoded with numbers that define parameters. These **parameters** are then **subject** to rules or **algorithms** that **dictate how they relate to one another**.

## Composition/Construction:
^composition
**Complexity increases** within a **direction** of **composition**, where a set of **compositional elements compose** a **new**, higher level abstraction or **structure**, and this sets of this subsequent structure, itself, composes a relative, new and higher level abstraction. 
	*Sets of numbers* composing *sets of domains* composing *sets of points* composing *sets of vectors* composing *sets of planes* composing *sets of curves* composing *sets of surfaces* composing *sets of solids*, etc... ^1cd6a4

**SETS** of these [[Elemental Building Blocks]] are constructed in Grasshopper via [[Data Trees#Lists|lists]] and [[Data Trees#Data Structures|Data Structures]]. And as follows, the composition of sets of these data structures represent or compose design elements, aspects or components of an object. 

This is called a **many to one** direction - i.e. construction.
That is, **a set of components** is used to **generate a single output.**
[[Numbers]] -> [[Points]] -> [[Grids]] -> [[Curves]] -> [[Surfaces]] -> [[Solids]]

## Decomposition/Deconstruction:
^decomposition
An object can be **analyzed** to **identify** its **compositional** **structure**- that is the components that underlay or are used to construct the object.

Decomposition **enables** the **extraction** of **data** from an object, which we can then identify, control, or manipulate. 
Thus, identifying, controlling, or manipulating the relationships of the compositional elements of that object and thus **the object itself**. 

This is called a **one to many** direction - i.e. **deconstruction**.
That is, a **single input** is used to **generate a set of outputs**.
