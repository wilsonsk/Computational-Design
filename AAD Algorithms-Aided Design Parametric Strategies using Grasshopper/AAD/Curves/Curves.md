# Curves

## Curves are exemplary parametric objects
Understanding how they work gives insight into both the form-making possibilities of curves and into parametric modeling in general.

## Free Form Curves: 
Facilitate the expression of polynomial curves (that is constrained, relational numbers- polynomial expressions).

Curves can be described by a specifying a set of points objects or points that form an **abstract** representation of a curve. 

An algorithm then computes the curves from these objects. 
	For example a **circle** can be described as a **center**, a **radius** and a **plane** to the which the circle is **parallel**. 

## Conic sections:
- Are circles, parabolas, hyperbolas, and ellipses are described by polynomial equations of maximum degree 2. 
	- Are easy to construct and can be **joined** without obvious **kinks** (i.e. first order continuity), **but**
		- **Cannot achieve** higher smoothness (**smooth connections**)

## Interpolation vs. Approximation:
#### Interpolation: 
Curve algorithms that interpolate, **compute** curves that **go through** the **input points**.

##### Approximate: 
Curves algorithms that approximate, **place** curves "near" the **input points**. 
- Generally the most dominant mode. 
	- The reason being, they tend to be geometrically more **predictable** and "well-behaved", and are mathematically more **simple**. 
##### Input Points: 
Are the **control points** and the (possible open) polygon the control points define is the curve's ***control polygon*.**
- **Control Polygon:**
	- Is defined by the straight lines between consecutive control points.
##### Linear Interpolation == *tweening* 
The **fundamental constructor** for many kinds of curves utilizes the concept of *linear interpolation* or *tweening*. 
- Abstractly interpolation moves a value **within** a set of other values.
	- **Linear** interpolation moves this values *smoothly* and in **constant proportion**. ^linear-interpolation

##### Parametric curves:
Are generated by linearly interpolating a parameter (i.e. moving a value within a set of other values) in an equation to produce the points on the curve.
- **Parametric lines**: the point and the parameter have a **direct** relationship 
	- ==**Equal increments** between **parameter values** produce corresponding **equal increments** between the **points** on the line.== 
- In contrast, in **curves** this relationship between increments of parameter values and increments of points is **indirect**. 
	- ==**Equal increments** between **parameter values** produce corresponding **UNEQUAL increments** between the **points** on the line.== 
		- This behavior has a **massive** implication on the form making process.

##### **Parametric Curve Representation**:
Like parametric lines, parametric curves are defined by a point that moves with a **parameter, t**. 

Unlike lines, the movement is **not linear**
- The distance or intervals between one curve is not the same as another curve. The number of equal divisions of varying lengths of a curve themselves vary between curves. 
	- This is where uniform scaling/normalization/reparameterization come into play. As by rescaling a curves length to 0-1, the number of divisions can be equated between curves.
- **Geometric spaces** and **parametric spaces** are **different**.
	- See Parametric Representation of curves in [[Nurbs Curves#^65f47a|Parametric Representation]]

##### Relating Curves to Objects:
In design, curves form relationships with other objects, and complex relationships are composed of simpler relationships. 

**Two basic relationships** are defined by vectors:
###### 1. Tangent vectors
- Almost every point p(t) on a curve has a family of vectors tangent to it. The sole exception is when the *first derivative* (from calculus) is not defined or is the zero vector.
- Of the infinitely many vectors tangent at a **parametric point** only **one** is *the* **tangent vector**. 
	- The reason is that the **length** of the tangent vector captures the **rate** at which *p(t)* **moves** along the curve as *t* changes. 
		- Therefore, the **lengths** of tangent vectors **vary** along the curve. 
	- The relative geometric distances (increments) between points along a curve, approximate the relative tangent vector lengths. 
		- When successive points are *close together*, the tangent vectors are correspondingly short. 
	![[Pasted image 20240321003446.png|300]]
	- **Normalizing** the tangent vector gives the **unit tangent vector**.
###### 2. Normal vectors
 - ![[Pasted image 20240321003419.png|300]]
- In **2D space** a curve *almost* every **point** always has a **unique** direction vector **normal** (i.e. perpendicular) to the curve. 
	- **Two** vectors, *pointing* (i.e. direction) to "to/away" from each side of the curve
	- We *pick* the direction that *points* **into the curve.**
		- **It lies in the PLANE of the curve**
- In **3D** space, it is a more complicated situation.
	- A point on the curve and its tangent vector define a **plane** normal to the curve at that **point**.
	- **Every** vector **in this plane** is normal to the curve.
		- **However** there is a **specific vector** in that plane- the **normal vector** of the curve at *p(t)*.
			- It is a **unit of length** and it lies in the **osculating plane** of the curve at *p(t)*.
			- ![[Pasted image 20240323094815.png]]
			- Lying in this plane is the **osculating circle** which is the circle that is both tangent to and has the same curvature as the curve at *p(t)*.
				- The **radius** of the osculating circle is the **normal vector** of *P*. 
				- The **center point** of the osculating circles at each point along the curve define another curve called the **evolute**. ^osculating-circle
			- ![[Pasted image 20240323094731.png|300]]
###### Binormal Vector:
	- Is the **cross product** of the **unit tangent vector** and the **normal vector**.
###### Frenet Frame:
- The **unit tangent vector**, **normal vector**, and the **binormal vector** can be **combined** into a structure that (with few exceptions) provides a sensible **coordinate** system at every point on the curve.
	- Each representing the x, y and z axix of the frame.
		- **unit tangent vector** = x axis
		- **normal vector** = y axis
		- **binormal vector** = z axis
- Is an **orthonormal frame** defined at (almost) every point on a 3D curve.
- **Inflection Point**:
	- The point of inflection or **flex**, is the point on a smooth curve where the curvature changes **sign**.
		- I.e. it's a point where the function changes from **concave** to **convex** or vice versa.
- The **problem** with frenet frames lies in their inflection points.
	- at a singular inflection points, Frenet frames are not defined. 
	- Inflection points rarely occur in 3D curves, instead **High Torsion** becomes something to deal with.
		- **High Torsion** is when a point crosses an inflection point, the Frenet frame seems to invert, instantaneously rotating or "twisting" 180 degrees around the **tangent vector**.
			- i.e. A curve that comes close to an inflection condition results in its Frenet frame **rapidly rotating around** the curve.
		- **The Solution**
			- Create a **reference direction** that not dependent on the local context of the point *p(t)* on the curve. 
			- Then place a frame on the curve:
				- With its **x vector** set to be the x vector of the Frenet frame.
				- Its **z vector** at **right angles** to the x vector
				- And its **z vector** **co-planar** with the x vector and the reference vector. 
###### Hodograph:
	- Is a curve defined by the ends of the tangent vectors
	- It is the **first derivation** of the curve.
		- The hodograph of the hodograph is the **second derivation**. ^01ae23

##### Continuity: (i.e. when curves join)
Continuity has different behavior with respect to:
**[[Parametric Space]]:** *C* 
- if a curve is **connected**: it has *C0* continuity.
	- if its first derivation is continuous: the original curve has *C1* continuity.
	- if the *nth* derivation is continuous: the original curve has *Cn* continuity.
- *C* continuity does **not** mean that a curve is geometrically smooth.
###### [[Geometric Space]]: *G* 
- If a curve has *C0* continuity: it is *G0* continuous- it is connected and this means the same thing in both parametric and geometric space.
- If a curve is *G0* continuous and its tangent direction varies continuously: the curve is *G1* continuous.
##### [[Bezier Curves]] 
##### Splines:
- is a **composite curves** composed of relating parts.
	- **Problematic example**: Bezier curves **joined** together to make splines.
		- reason for problems: despite simple geometry and math, the control is only **pseudo-local** and the order of a Bezier curve is the number of points in the control polygon.
			- **pseudo-local control**: means that **all points in a curve** **change** when **any** control point is **changed**
				- **Monomial**: a component element of a polynomial. A product of constants and variables raised to exponents that are positive integers. 
					- ex. 3x^2
				- **Polynomials an Monomials** have **2 descriptors**:
					- **Degree (d):** the maximum (highest) exponent value in the polynomial.
					- **Order (n):** n= degree + 1
				- Bezier curves take their order and thus degree from the number of **vertices** in the **control polygon**.
					- ex. an order 4 Bezier curve has a four-point control polygon, and order 3 Bezier curve has a three-point control polygon, etc.
				- **Therefore**: The link between order and control points means that a complex design must be done with high-order curves and this creates problems in interactive editing:
					- it is easy to introduce local bumps and hard to make a curve visually fair.
					- the curve may also lie far from the control polygon, making it hard to predict how an editing action might affect the curve
				- **SOLUTION:**
					- **All** of these problems can be addressed and **remedied** by **connecting a series of curves** into a **composite curve** - a **SPLINE CURVE**
						- Unfortunately, Bezier curves do not spline gracefully.
###### B-Splines: basically just a **framework** for **constructing** Bezier curves
- Defined **ON** a control polygon.
- Are easily splined and thus address all the problems of Bezier curves. 
	- So easily splined that often no distinction is made between a curve (one spline segment) and a spline (multiple segments).
- The only **constraint** on the **order** of the curve is that it **must be less than or equal to the number of points in the control polygon**.
- Provide **two new modeling controls** to the control points:
	- **knots**:
	- **independent specification of order**:
- Are essentially just a new way to specify a Bezier control polygon that, in turn, defines the intended curve. 

Curves have **one more control**: **WEIGHTS**, which are introduced in the step from B-Splines to Non Uniform Rational B-Splines ([[Nurbs Curves]])
