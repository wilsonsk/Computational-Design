Draw lines and relationships with the concepts of transformations, algorithms (if, then) and parameters that drive the form. 

Dont aimlessly draw lines, but think mainly. The marks are the expression of a form of thinking. 

Utilize the perspective and isometric techniques, but dont think in those terms.

Think in terms of parameters, relationships, transformations, and computations and then any lines or marks made are just simply expressed in the rules of perspective/isometric but not determined by them.
